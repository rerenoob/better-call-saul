# Testing Strategy: Cloud-Agnostic Migration
*Created: 2025-09-14*

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Provider Parity**: All providers must deliver functionally equivalent results
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintain or exceed current system quality across all providers
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure acceptable performance characteristics for each provider
- **Failure Resilience**: Validate graceful degradation and error handling scenarios
- **Configuration Integrity**: Test all configuration combinations and edge cases

### Quality Gates
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% code coverage for all new abstraction layers
- **Integration Test Coverage**: 100% coverage of provider switching scenarios
- **Performance Benchmarks**: All providers must perform within 15% of baseline
- **Security Validation**: All providers must pass security scanning and penetration tests

## Test Categories and Frameworks

### 1. Unit Testing

#### Framework and Tools

- **Mocking**: Moq for service mocking and dependency injection testing
- **Coverage**: Coverlet for code coverage analysis
- **Assertions**: FluentAssertions for readable test assertions

#### Test Scope
**Service Interface Tests**
```csharp
public class IAIServiceContractTests
{
    [Theory]
    [InlineData("Azure")]
    [InlineData("AWS")]
    [InlineData("Google")]
    public async Task AnalyzeCaseAsync_ShouldReturnValidResponse_ForAllProviders(string provider)
    {
        // Arrange
        var service = ServiceFactory.CreateAIService(provider);
        var request = CreateValidAIRequest();

        // Act
        var response = await service.AnalyzeCaseAsync(request);

        // Assert
        response.Should().NotBeNull();
        response.Success.Should().BeTrue();
        response.GeneratedText.Should().NotBeNullOrEmpty();
        response.ConfidenceScore.Should().BeInRange(0, 1);
    }
}
```

    {
        // Arrange
        var service = await CreateConfiguredService(provider);
        var testCase = GetStandardTestCase();

        // Act
        var result = await service.AnalyzeCaseAsync(testCase);
