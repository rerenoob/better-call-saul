# Product Requirements Document: AWS Migration
*Created: 2025-09-14*

## Overview

### Problem Statement
The Better Call Saul application is currently tightly coupled to Azure services (OpenAI, Blob Storage, Form Recognizer), creating vendor lock-in and limiting deployment flexibility. The application needs AWS compatibility to provide deployment flexibility and potentially reduce costs.

### Feature Summary
Migrate the Better Call Saul AI Lawyer application from Azure-specific services to AWS-compatible services while maintaining all existing functionality and performance characteristics.

### Goals
1. **AWS Compatibility**: Enable production deployment on AWS infrastructure
2. **Service Migration**: Replace Azure services with AWS equivalents
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Switch between Azure and AWS using environment variables
4. **Feature Parity**: Maintain all existing functionality with AWS services
5. **Cost Optimization**: Leverage AWS pricing advantages where applicable

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Application deploys successfully on AWS with full functionality
- ✅ Minimal code changes required to switch between Azure and AWS
- ✅ All existing features work identically on AWS
- ✅ Performance remains within 10% of current Azure implementation
- ✅ AWS deployment provides cost advantages over Azure

## User Experience

### Deployment Flow
1. **Provider Selection**: Configure cloud provider via environment variables
2. **Service Configuration**: Set provider-specific endpoints and credentials
3. **Validation**: System validates configuration and connectivity on startup
4. **Runtime**: Application operates identically regardless of provider

### Administrative Experience
- Configuration changes require only environment variable updates
- Real-time provider switching for disaster recovery scenarios
- Unified monitoring and logging across all providers
- Cost optimization through provider comparison tools

## Acceptance Criteria

### Provider Support
- [ ] AWS deployment with Bedrock, S3, and Textract
- [ ] Azure deployment (current functionality maintained)
- [ ] Local/development deployment with mock services
- [ ] Provider switching between Azure and AWS via configuration

### Feature Compatibility
- [ ] All existing API endpoints function identically
- [ ] Case analysis produces equivalent results across providers
- [ ] File upload/download works seamlessly
- [ ] Document text extraction maintains accuracy levels
- [ ] User authentication and authorization preserved

### Operational Requirements
- [ ] Single configuration file controls all provider settings
- [ ] Zero-downtime provider switching for supported scenarios
- [ ] Comprehensive health checks for all services
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline validates all provider combinations

## Open Questions ⚠️

### Technical Uncertainties
- **Q1**: How should we handle provider-specific AI model differences (e.g., token limits, context windows)?
- **Q2**: Should we implement automatic provider failover or require manual configuration?
- **Q3**: How do we normalize confidence scores across different document processing services?
- **Q4**: What's the approach for handling provider-specific features not available elsewhere?

### Business Decisions
- **Q5**: Should AWS be the primary deployment target going forward?
- **Q6**: Should we maintain separate deployment templates for Azure and AWS?
- **Q7**: How do we handle cost optimization between Azure and AWS?
- **Q8**: What's the strategy for AWS-specific performance optimizations?

### Operational Concerns
- **Q9**: How do we manage secrets across Azure and AWS?
- **Q10**: Should monitoring and logging be provider-specific or unified?
- **Q11**: What's the disaster recovery strategy between Azure and AWS?
- **Q12**: How do we handle data residency requirements across regions?

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Cloud provider SDKs (AWS SDK, Azure SDK)
- Provider-specific AI service access (API keys, service accounts)
- Container orchestration platform (Kubernetes, Docker, cloud-native)
- Secrets management system (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)

### Internal Dependencies
- Database migration strategy for provider-specific metadata
- Frontend configuration updates for provider-specific endpoints
- DevOps pipeline updates for multi-provider deployments
- Testing infrastructure for provider validation

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing Azure deployments
- Provider abstractions must not introduce significant performance overhead
