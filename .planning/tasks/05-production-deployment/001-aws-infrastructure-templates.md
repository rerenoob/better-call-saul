# Task: Create AWS Infrastructure as Code Templates

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: Phase 5 Production Deployment - Task 5.2 Production Deployment Validation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 02-aws-implementation/008-textract-document-analysis: AWS services implementation completed
- [ ] 04-integration-testing/003-quality-assurance-testing: Quality tests completed

### External Dependencies
- AWS account with appropriate service limits and permissions
- Understanding of production security and compliance requirements
- Domain name and SSL certificate for production deployment

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `infrastructure/aws/cloudformation/main-stack.yaml`: Master CloudFormation template
- `infrastructure/aws/cloudformation/compute.yaml`: App Service and container configuration
- `infrastructure/aws/cloudformation/storage.yaml`: S3 buckets and data storage
- `infrastructure/aws/cloudformation/ai-services.yaml`: Bedrock and Textract permissions
- `infrastructure/aws/cloudformation/security.yaml`: IAM roles and security policies
- `infrastructure/aws/scripts/deploy.sh`: Deployment automation script
- `infrastructure/aws/parameters/production.json`: Production parameter values

### Code Patterns
- Follow AWS CloudFormation best practices for modularity
- Use nested stacks for logical separation of concerns
- Implement proper parameter management and validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CloudFormation templates deploy complete AWS infrastructure for Better Call Saul
- [ ] All required AWS services properly configured (ECS/Fargate, S3, Bedrock, Textract)
- [ ] IAM roles and policies follow least privilege principle
- [ ] Security groups and network configuration properly isolated
- [ ] Environment variables and secrets management integrated
- [ ] Automated deployment script with rollback capabilities

## Testing Strategy
- Infrastructure tests: Template validation and deployment testing
- Security tests: IAM policy and network security validation
- Integration tests: Application deployment and functionality validation

## System Stability
- Infrastructure supports auto-scaling and high availability
- Proper backup and disaster recovery configuration
- Monitoring and alerting for all critical components
