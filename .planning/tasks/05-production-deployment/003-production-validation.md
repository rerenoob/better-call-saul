# Task: Execute Production Deployment Validation and Monitoring

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: Phase 5 Production Deployment - Task 5.2 Production Deployment Validation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 7 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 05-production-deployment/001-aws-infrastructure-templates: Infrastructure templates completed
- [ ] 05-production-deployment/002-deployment-automation: Deployment automation completed

### External Dependencies
- Production AWS environment fully deployed
- Monitoring and alerting systems configured
- Production domain name and SSL certificates

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `scripts/production-validation.sh`: Comprehensive production validation script
- `monitoring/aws/cloudwatch-dashboards.json`: CloudWatch monitoring dashboards
- `monitoring/aws/alerts.json`: CloudWatch alerts and notifications
- `tests/production/smoke-tests.sh`: Production smoke test suite
- `documentation/aws-production-runbook.md`: Production operations guide

### Code Patterns
- Implement comprehensive health check validation
- Use monitoring best practices for production systems
- Create clear operational procedures and runbooks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Production deployment successfully passes all validation tests
- [ ] All application features function identically to existing Azure deployment
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable range of Azure baseline
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards provide comprehensive system visibility
- [ ] Alerting system configured for critical system events
- [ ] Production runbook completed with troubleshooting procedures

## Testing Strategy
- Smoke tests: Critical path functionality validation
- Performance tests: Production load and response time validation
- Integration tests: End-to-end workflow validation in production

## System Stability
- Comprehensive monitoring covers all critical system components
- Automated alerting for performance degradation or errors
- Clear escalation procedures for production incidents
