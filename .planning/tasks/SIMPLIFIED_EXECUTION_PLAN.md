# Simplified AWS Migration: Task Execution Plan
*Updated for AWS-only approach*

## Overview
**Total Tasks**: 8 (reduced from 24)
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks (reduced from 8 weeks)
**Focus**: AWS production deployment readiness

## Task Summary by Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) - 13 hours
1. **001-ai-service-interface** (4h) - Create IAIService for Azure/AWS switching
2. **002-storage-service-interface** (3h) - Create IStorageService for Azure/AWS switching
3. **003-configuration-and-di** (6h) - AWS configuration and dependency injection setup

### Phase 2: AWS Implementation (Week 2-3) - 42 hours
4. **001-aws-bedrock-complete** (16h) - Complete AWS Bedrock AI service
5. **002-aws-s3-complete** (12h) - Complete AWS S3 storage service
6. **003-aws-textract-complete** (14h) - Complete AWS Textract document processing

### Phase 3: Testing & Deployment (Week 3-4) - 28 hours
7. **001-azure-aws-validation** (10h) - Integration testing Azure vs AWS
8. **001-infrastructure-and-deployment** (18h) - AWS production deployment

**Total Effort**: 83 hours (approximately 10-11 working days)

## Critical Path Analysis
**Sequential Tasks**: 47 hours (6 working days)
1. → 3. → 4. → 7. → 8.

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- **Week 1**: Tasks 1, 2 can run parallel; Task 3 depends on both
- **Week 2-3**: Tasks 4, 5, 6 can run parallel after Task 3
- **Week 3-4**: Task 7 must complete before Task 8

## Week-by-Week Execution Plan

### Week 1: Foundation Setup
**Parallel Work (2 developers)**
```
Developer A: Task 1 - AI Service Interface (4h)
Developer B: Task 2 - Storage Service Interface (3h)
Both: Task 3 - Configuration & DI Setup (6h)
```
**Deliverables**: Service interfaces ready, AWS configuration system working

### Week 2: AWS Services Implementation
**Parallel Work (2-3 developers)**
```
Developer A: Task 4 - AWS Bedrock Service (16h)
Developer B: Task 5 - AWS S3 Service (12h)
Developer C: Task 6 - AWS Textract Service (14h)
```
**Deliverables**: All AWS services functional and comparable to Azure

### Week 3: Integration & Testing
**Sequential Work**
```
Team: Task 7 - Azure vs AWS Validation (10h)
Team: Start Task 8 - Infrastructure Setup (8h)
```
**Deliverables**: AWS services validated, infrastructure templates ready

### Week 4: Production Deployment
**Sequential Work**
```
Team: Complete Task 8 - Production Deployment (10h remaining)
Team: Production validation and documentation
```
**Deliverables**: AWS production environment operational

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### External Requirements
- **AWS Account**: Production account with Bedrock access
- **IAM Permissions**: Full service access for deployment
- **Development Environment**: AWS CLI, .NET 8 SDK

### Team Requirements
- **Minimum**: 2 senior full-stack developers
- **Optimal**: 2 developers + 1 DevOps engineer
- **Skills**: .NET Core, AWS services, Infrastructure as Code

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **AWS Bedrock Learning Curve** (Task 4): Allow extra time for Claude API integration
2. **Infrastructure Complexity** (Task 8): Use proven CloudFormation patterns
3. **Performance Differences**: Establish early benchmarks

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Azure Fallback**: Keep Azure services as backup during transition
- **Staged Deployment**: Test in AWS staging before production
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track metrics from day one

## Success Metrics by Week

### Week 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Service interfaces compile and implement correctly
- [ ] Configuration loads AWS settings successfully
- [ ] Provider switching works via CloudProvider.Active setting

### Week 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] AWS Bedrock produces case analysis comparable to Azure OpenAI
- [ ] AWS S3 handles file operations identically to Azure Blob
- [ ] AWS Textract extracts text with acceptable accuracy

### Week 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] Integration tests pass for both Azure and AWS providers
- [ ] Performance within 15% between providers
- [ ] AWS infrastructure templates deploy successfully

### Week 4 Success Criteria
- [ ] AWS production environment fully operational
- [ ] End-to-end functionality validated
- [ ] Documentation complete for AWS deployment

## Cost & Resource Optimization

### Development Resources
- **Week 1**: 2 developers × 13 hours = 26 dev-hours
- **Week 2**: 3 developers × 14 hours = 42 dev-hours
- **Week 3**: 2 developers × 18 hours = 36 dev-hours
- **Week 4**: 2 developers × 10 hours = 20 dev-hours

**Total**: 124 dev-hours vs 206 hours for multi-cloud approach (40% reduction)

### AWS Service Costs
- **Bedrock**: Pay-per-token, estimated $50-200/month
- **S3**: Storage + requests, estimated $20-50/month
- **Textract**: Pay-per-page, estimated $30-100/month
- **Infrastructure**: ECS/App Runner, estimated $100-300/month

This simplified plan achieves AWS production deployment in 3-4 weeks while maintaining quality and reducing complexity significantly.
