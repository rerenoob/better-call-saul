# Task: Manual Testing and Bug Fixes

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: Testing & Quality (TEST-007 from 3_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] All feature implementation tasks must be completed
- [ ] 001-integration-testing.md: Automated tests should pass first

### External Dependencies
- Various test documents (PDF, DOCX) for comprehensive testing

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `Testing/ManualTestPlan.md`: Comprehensive manual testing checklist
- `Testing/TestDocuments/`: Sample documents for testing
- `Testing/BugTracker.md`: Track discovered issues and resolutions
- Various bug fix commits across the application

### Code Patterns
- Systematic testing of all user workflows
- Cross-browser and device testing
- Error handling and edge case validation

### API/Data Structures

# Manual Test Plan

## User Authentication
- [ ] User registration with valid email/password
- [ ] User registration with invalid data (error handling)
- [ ] User login with correct credentials
- [ ] User login with incorrect credentials
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Logout functionality

## Document Processing
- [ ] Upload valid PDF document
- [ ] Upload valid DOCX document
- [ ] Upload invalid file type (should be rejected)
- [ ] Upload oversized file (should be rejected)
- [ ] Text extraction verification
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete manual test plan created and executed
- [ ] All critical user workflows tested end-to-end
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile device testing (responsive design validation)
- [ ] Error handling tested for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing with realistic document sizes
- [ ] All discovered critical bugs fixed
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] Application deploys and runs correctly
- [ ] User experience is smooth and intuitive

## Testing Strategy
- Systematic workflow testing: Follow complete user journeys
- Boundary testing: Test limits (file sizes, text length, etc.)
- Error scenario testing: Network failures, invalid data, etc.
- Usability testing: Verify intuitive user experience
- Performance verification: Reasonable response times

## System Stability
- How this task maintains operational state: Ensures all features work reliably together
- Rollback strategy if needed: Fix critical bugs, disable problematic features if necessary
- Impact on existing functionality: Validates and improves stability of all features
