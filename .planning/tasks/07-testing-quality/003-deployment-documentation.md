# Task: Deployment Documentation and Final Polish

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: Testing & Quality (TEST-007 from 3_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Estimated Time**: 3 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 002-manual-testing.md: All testing must be completed
- [ ] All bugs from manual testing must be resolved

### External Dependencies
- None (documentation task)

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- Update `README.md`: Complete project setup and running instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Deployment guide for production environments
- Update `CLAUDE.md`: Final project documentation for Claude Code
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Document all implemented features and changes
- `docs/API.md`: Basic API documentation (if applicable)

### Code Patterns
- Clear, step-by-step instructions
- Include troubleshooting section
- Document all configuration requirements

### API/Data Structures
```markdown

## Running the Application
## Testing
## Deployment
## Troubleshooting
## Contributing
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README.md provides complete setup instructions for new developers
- [ ] All required environment variables and configurations documented
- [ ] Database setup and migration instructions clear
- [ ] Azure OpenAI setup instructions provided
- [ ] Local development workflow documented
- [ ] Production deployment guide created
- [ ] Known issues and limitations documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting section covers common problems
- [ ] All major features documented with examples
- [ ] Project is ready for handoff or production deployment

## Testing Strategy
- Documentation validation: Follow instructions on fresh environment
- Completeness check: Verify all setup steps are documented
- Clarity testing: Have someone else follow the documentation

## System Stability
- How this task maintains operational state: Documentation doesn't affect functionality
- Rollback strategy if needed: Revert documentation changes
- Impact on existing functionality: None (enables proper deployment and maintenance)
