## Critical Path

**Sequential Dependencies:**
1. Foundation Infrastructure → Authentication → Document Processing
2. Document Processing → Case Management
3. Case Management → AI Integration  
4. All Features → UI Polish → Testing & Quality

**Total Estimated Time:** ~96 hours (12-14 working days)

## Parallel Work Opportunities

**Week 1-2: Foundation + Auth**
- Foundation tasks can be done sequentially
- Authentication UI can be developed while Identity is being set up

**Week 3-4: Documents + Cases**
- File upload UI can be developed parallel to text extraction service
- Case UI components can be developed parallel to case service layer

**Week 5-6: AI + UI Polish**
- AI service setup can happen parallel to analysis UI development
- UI polish can begin once core features are stable

## Key Integration Points

1. **Database Models**: User → Case → Document → CaseAnalysis relationships
2. **File Processing**: Upload → Storage → Text Extraction → AI Analysis
3. **User Experience**: Authentication → Dashboard → Case Management → AI Results

## Validation Checkpoints

- **End of Week 2**: User can register, login, upload files
- **End of Week 4**: User can create cases, associate documents, view case details
- **End of Week 6**: AI analysis working, complete MVP functionality

## Usage Instructions

1. **Task Selection**: Start with foundation tasks, follow dependency chain
2. **Time Estimates**: Each task designed for 4-8 hours of focused work
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Use checklist to verify task completion
4. **Dependencies**: Complete prerequisite tasks before starting new ones
5. **Testing**: Validate system stability after each task

## Notes

- All estimates include implementation, basic testing, and documentation
- Tasks are designed to maintain system operability throughout development
- Each task includes rollback strategy for risk mitigation
- Authorization and security considerations included in relevant tasks
