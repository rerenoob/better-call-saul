# Task: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration and Automation

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-008 Deployment and Documentation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 5 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 08-deployment-docs/001-azure-infrastructure-setup.md: Infrastructure needed for deployment
- [x] 07-testing-qa/001-backend-unit-integration-tests.md: Tests to run in pipeline

### External Dependencies
- GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps for CI/CD
- Docker containers for consistent build environments
- Deployment credentials and service connections

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `.github/workflows/backend-ci-cd.yml`: Backend CI/CD pipeline
- `.github/workflows/frontend-ci-cd.yml`: Frontend CI/CD pipeline
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`: Security scanning pipeline
- `scripts/build-backend.sh`: Backend build script
- `scripts/build-frontend.sh`: Frontend build script
- `docker/Dockerfile.api`: Backend container configuration

### Code Patterns
- Use GitHub Actions with reusable workflows
- Implement multi-stage builds for Docker containers
- Use environment-specific deployment strategies

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated builds triggered on code commits and pull requests
- [ ] Unit and integration tests executed in CI pipeline
- [ ] Security scanning integrated into build process
- [ ] Automated deployment to staging environment on main branch
- [ ] Production deployment with manual approval gate
- [ ] Build artifacts stored and versioned appropriately
- [ ] Deployment rollback capabilities implemented
- [ ] Pipeline notifications and status reporting configured

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Pipeline configuration validation
- Integration tests: End-to-end deployment testing
- Manual validation: Deploy to staging and production environments

## System Stability
- Implement deployment health checks and validation
- Configure automated rollback on deployment failures
- Monitor deployment success rates and performance

## Notes
- Use blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime releases
- Implement feature flags for progressive rollout
- Plan for database migration automation in CI/CD
