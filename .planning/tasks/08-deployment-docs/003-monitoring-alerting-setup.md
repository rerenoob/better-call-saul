# Task: Application Monitoring and Alerting Configuration

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-008 Deployment and Documentation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 5 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 08-deployment-docs/001-azure-infrastructure-setup.md: Application Insights needed
- [x] 08-deployment-docs/002-cicd-pipeline-configuration.md: Deployed application to monitor

### External Dependencies
- Azure Application Insights and Azure Monitor
- Alerting channels (email, Slack, Teams)
- Dashboard and visualization tools

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `monitoring/application-insights-config.json`: Application Insights configuration
- `monitoring/azure-monitor-alerts.bicep`: Alert rules infrastructure
- `monitoring/custom-metrics.cs`: Custom telemetry and metrics
- `monitoring/dashboards/production-dashboard.json`: Production monitoring dashboard
- `docs/monitoring-runbook.md`: Monitoring and alerting procedures
- `scripts/setup-monitoring.ps1`: Monitoring setup script

### Code Patterns
- Use Application Insights SDK for custom telemetry
- Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
- Use Azure Monitor for infrastructure and application monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application performance monitoring with response time tracking
- [ ] Error rate monitoring and exception tracking
- [ ] Custom business metrics (case analysis completion, user activity)
- [ ] Infrastructure monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- [ ] Availability monitoring with synthetic transactions
- [ ] Alert rules for critical issues (high error rates, performance degradation)
- [ ] Alerting integrations with email and collaboration tools
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards for operational visibility

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Custom telemetry and metrics collection
- Integration tests: Alert rule triggering and notification delivery
- Manual validation: Monitor application under load and verify alerting

## System Stability
- Implement monitoring for all critical system components
- Configure appropriate alert thresholds to minimize false positives
- Set up on-call procedures and escalation paths

## Notes
- Consider implementing log aggregation and analysis
- Plan for capacity monitoring and auto-scaling triggers
- Set up security monitoring and anomaly detection
