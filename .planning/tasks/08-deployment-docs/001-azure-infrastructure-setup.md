# Task: Azure Infrastructure Setup and Provisioning

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-008 Deployment and Documentation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/005-azure-services-integration.md: Azure services configuration needed
- [x] 07-testing-qa/004-performance-load-testing.md: Performance requirements for sizing

### External Dependencies
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- DNS domain for production deployment
- SSL certificates for HTTPS

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `infrastructure/azure-resources.bicep`: Infrastructure as Code template
- `infrastructure/parameters/production.json`: Production environment parameters
- `infrastructure/parameters/staging.json`: Staging environment parameters
- `scripts/deploy-infrastructure.ps1`: Infrastructure deployment script
- `docs/azure-architecture-diagram.md`: Architecture documentation
- `.github/workflows/infrastructure.yml`: Infrastructure CI/CD pipeline

### Code Patterns
- Use Azure Bicep for declarative infrastructure deployment
- Implement environment-specific parameter files
- Use Azure Resource Manager tags for resource organization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Azure App Service configured for .NET Web API deployment
- [ ] Azure Static Web Apps configured for React frontend
- [ ] Azure SQL Database provisioned with appropriate sizing
- [ ] Azure Key Vault configured for secrets management
- [ ] Azure Storage Account configured for file uploads
- [ ] Application Insights configured for monitoring and telemetry
- [ ] Azure CDN configured for static asset delivery
- [ ] Custom domain and SSL certificates configured

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Bicep template validation and parameter testing
- Integration tests: Infrastructure deployment to test environment
- Manual validation: Verify all Azure resources are properly configured

## System Stability
- Implement infrastructure monitoring and alerting
- Configure automated backups and disaster recovery
- Set up cost monitoring and budget alerts

## Notes
- Use least-privilege access principles for all Azure resources
- Plan for multi-region deployment in future iterations
- Implement infrastructure drift detection and remediation
