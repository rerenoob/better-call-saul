# Task: OCR and Text Extraction Integration

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-002 File Upload and Processing Pipeline
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 02-file-processing/002-virus-scanning-validation.md: Files must be validated before processing
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/005-azure-services-integration.md: Azure Form Recognizer needed

### External Dependencies
- Azure Form Recognizer service
- Document format libraries (PDF, DOC processing)

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Services/ITextExtractionService.cs`: Text extraction interface
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/AzureFormRecognizerService.cs`: OCR implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/DocumentText.cs`: Extracted text model
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/DocumentParserService.cs`: Format-specific parsing
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/TextExtractionResult.cs`: Extraction result model
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Controllers/DocumentProcessingController.cs`: Processing endpoints

### Code Patterns
- Use Azure Form Recognizer SDK with async operations
- Implement factory pattern for different document types
- Store extracted text with original formatting metadata

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PDF text extraction maintains document structure and formatting
- [ ] OCR works for scanned documents and images within PDFs
- [ ] DOC/DOCX files processed with native text extraction
- [ ] Text extraction preserves page numbers and section headers
- [ ] Extracted text quality validation (confidence scoring)
- [ ] Processing status tracking for long-running operations
- [ ] Extracted text stored securely with encryption
- [ ] Error handling for corrupted or unsupported documents

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Text extraction logic with sample documents
- Integration tests: Azure Form Recognizer API integration
- Manual validation: Process various document types and verify accuracy

## System Stability
- Implement retry logic for transient Azure service failures
- Queue-based processing for resource-intensive OCR operations
- Monitor processing costs and implement usage limits

## Notes
- Consider caching extracted text to avoid reprocessing
- Implement text quality metrics for accuracy assessment
- Plan for multilingual document support in future iterations
