# Task: Virus Scanning and File Validation Pipeline

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-002 File Upload and Processing Pipeline
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 02-file-processing/001-secure-file-upload-api.md: Upload API must be available

### External Dependencies
- ClamAV antivirus or Azure Security Center integration
- File signature validation libraries

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Services/IVirusScanningService.cs`: Scanning service interface
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/ClamAvService.cs`: ClamAV integration
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Services/IFileValidationService.cs`: Validation interface
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/FileValidationService.cs`: Validation implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/ScanResult.cs`: Scan result model
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Program.cs`: Register scanning services

### Code Patterns
- Use async/await for scanning operations to avoid blocking
- Implement timeout handling for scanning operations
- Use dependency injection for testability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All uploaded files scanned for viruses before processing
- [ ] File signature validation confirms actual file type matches extension
- [ ] Quarantine system for infected files
- [ ] Scan results logged with file metadata
- [ ] Scanning timeout handled gracefully (30 seconds max)
- [ ] Clean files marked as safe for further processing
- [ ] Support for common document formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
- [ ] Scan service failures don't break the upload pipeline

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: File validation logic with various file types
- Integration tests: Virus scanning with test virus files (EICAR)
- Manual validation: Upload various file types and verify scanning

## System Stability
- Implement fallback validation if virus scanner unavailable
- Monitor scanner health and alert on failures
- Provide clear error messages for rejected files

## Notes
- Consider using Azure Security Center for cloud-native scanning
- Implement file signature database updates
- Log all scan results for security auditing
