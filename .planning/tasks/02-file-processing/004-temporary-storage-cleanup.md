# Task: Temporary Storage and Automated Cleanup

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-002 File Upload and Processing Pipeline
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 02-file-processing/001-secure-file-upload-api.md: Upload system needed
- [x] 02-file-processing/003-ocr-text-extraction.md: Processing completion triggers cleanup

### External Dependencies
- Azure Blob Storage lifecycle policies
- Background job processing (Hangfire or Azure Functions)

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Services/IFileCleanupService.cs`: Cleanup service interface
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/FileCleanupService.cs`: Cleanup implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Jobs/FileCleanupJob.cs`: Background job for cleanup
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/FileLifecycle.cs`: File lifecycle tracking
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Program.cs`: Register cleanup services and jobs

### Code Patterns
- Use background services for automated cleanup operations
- Implement soft delete before hard delete for safety
- Use Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management policies

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Temporary files automatically deleted after 24 hours
- [ ] Processed files moved to archive storage tier
- [ ] Failed processing files cleaned up after 48 hours
- [ ] Cleanup job runs every hour to check for expired files
- [ ] File metadata tracks creation and expiration timestamps
- [ ] Manual cleanup endpoint for administrative use
- [ ] Cleanup operations logged for audit purposes
- [ ] Storage cost optimization through lifecycle policies

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Cleanup logic and file expiration calculation
- Integration tests: Automated cleanup job execution
- Manual validation: Verify files are cleaned up on schedule

## System Stability
- Implement safety checks to prevent accidental data loss
- Monitor cleanup job execution and alert on failures
- Maintain cleanup statistics for operational monitoring

## Notes
- Configure different retention periods for different file types
- Consider user notification before automatic cleanup
- Implement emergency file recovery procedures
