# Task: Secure File Upload API Endpoint

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-002 File Upload and Processing Pipeline
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 5 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/003-jwt-authentication-setup.md: Authentication required for uploads
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/005-azure-services-integration.md: Azure Storage needed

### External Dependencies
- Azure Blob Storage account
- File validation libraries

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Controllers/FileUploadController.cs`: File upload endpoints
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Services/IFileUploadService.cs`: Upload service interface
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/FileUploadService.cs`: Upload implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/UploadResult.cs`: Upload response model
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Validators/FileUploadValidator.cs`: File validation logic
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Program.cs`: Add file upload configuration

### Code Patterns
- Use IFormFile for multipart/form-data uploads
- Implement async/await for all file operations
- Follow repository pattern for file metadata storage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] File upload endpoint accepts PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT files
- [ ] Maximum file size limit enforced (50MB)
- [ ] File type validation based on content, not just extension
- [ ] Virus scanning integration before processing
- [ ] Files uploaded to secure Azure Blob Storage container
- [ ] Upload progress tracking via unique upload session ID
- [ ] Proper error handling for failed uploads
- [ ] Authentication required for all upload operations

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: File validation logic and upload service methods
- Integration tests: End-to-end file upload with mocked storage
- Manual validation: Upload various file types and sizes

## System Stability
- Implement upload timeout to prevent hanging connections
- Clean up incomplete uploads after timeout period
- Monitor storage quota and implement cleanup policies

## Notes
- Generate unique file names to prevent conflicts
- Store original filename separately for user display
- Implement resumable upload for large files in future iteration
