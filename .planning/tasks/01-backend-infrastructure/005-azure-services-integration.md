# Task: Azure Services Integration and Configuration

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-001 Backend Infrastructure and API Setup
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 001-dotnet-project-setup.md: Basic project structure needed
- [x] 002-database-schema-design.md: Database connection required

### External Dependencies
- Azure subscription and resource group
- Azure Key Vault, Azure SQL Database, Azure Storage Account

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/AzureKeyVaultService.cs`: Key Vault integration
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Program.cs`: Add Azure service registrations
- `BetterCallSaul.API/appsettings.json`: Azure service endpoints
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Configuration/AzureOptions.cs`: Configuration model
- `azure-resources.bicep`: Infrastructure as Code template

### Code Patterns
- Use Azure SDK packages and managed identity when possible
- Implement proper retry policies for Azure service calls
- Follow Azure naming conventions and resource tagging

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Azure Key Vault integration working for secret management
- [ ] Azure SQL Database connection configured and tested
- [ ] Azure Storage Account accessible for file operations
- [ ] Application Insights configured for telemetry and logging
- [ ] Managed identity configured for Azure service authentication
- [ ] Resource provisioning automated via Bicep/ARM templates
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration working (dev/staging/prod)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Azure service client initialization and configuration
- Integration tests: Actual Azure service connectivity and operations
- Manual validation: Verify services are provisioned and accessible

## System Stability
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for Azure service dependencies
- Configure appropriate timeouts and retry policies
- Monitor Azure service quotas and limits

## Notes
- Use least-privilege access principles for Azure resources
- Set up cost monitoring and alerts for Azure services
- Document Azure resource dependencies and configurations
