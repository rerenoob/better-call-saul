# Task: Case Management Dashboard Interface

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-005 React Frontend Development
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 05-react-frontend/002-authentication-integration.md: User authentication required
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/002-database-schema-design.md: Case data structure needed

### External Dependencies
- Recharts or similar library for data visualization
- React Query for efficient data fetching and caching

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`: Main dashboard page component
- `src/components/dashboard/CaseOverview.tsx`: Case statistics overview
- `src/components/dashboard/RecentCases.tsx`: Recent cases list component
- `src/components/dashboard/CasePriorityChart.tsx`: Priority visualization
- `src/components/dashboard/QuickActions.tsx`: Quick action buttons
- `src/services/caseService.ts`: Case management API client
- `src/types/case.ts`: Case-related type definitions

### Code Patterns
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS grid/flexbox
- Use component composition for modular dashboard sections

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard loads within 2 seconds with optimized API calls
- [ ] Case overview showing total cases, pending, completed statistics
- [ ] Recent cases list with search and filter capabilities
- [ ] Case priority visualization with interactive charts
- [ ] Quick action buttons for common tasks (new case, upload document)
- [ ] Real-time updates when case status changes
- [ ] Responsive design works on tablet and mobile devices
- [ ] Loading states and error handling for all dashboard sections

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Dashboard components with mock data
- Integration tests: Dashboard data loading and state management
- Manual validation: Dashboard functionality across different screen sizes

## System Stability
- Implement proper loading states and skeleton screens
- Handle API failures with user-friendly error messages
- Optimize dashboard queries to prevent performance issues

## Notes
- Consider dashboard customization options for different user roles
- Implement dashboard widget drag-and-drop functionality in future
- Plan for real-time notifications integration
