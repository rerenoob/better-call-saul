# Task: File Upload Interface with Drag-and-Drop

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-005 React Frontend Development
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 05-react-frontend/001-react-project-setup.md: React foundation needed
- [x] 02-file-processing/001-secure-file-upload-api.md: Backend upload endpoints required

### External Dependencies
- React Dropzone for drag-and-drop functionality
- File type validation libraries

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/upload/FileUploader.tsx`: Main file upload component
- `src/components/upload/DragDropZone.tsx`: Drag-and-drop interface
- `src/components/upload/UploadProgress.tsx`: Upload progress indicator
- `src/components/upload/FilePreview.tsx`: File preview component
- `src/services/fileUploadService.ts`: File upload API integration
- `src/hooks/useFileUpload.ts`: File upload state management
- `src/types/upload.ts`: Upload-related type definitions

### Code Patterns
- Use React Dropzone for drag-and-drop functionality
- Implement chunked upload for large files
- Use progress tracking with real-time updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Drag-and-drop interface for file selection
- [ ] Multiple file selection and upload queue management
- [ ] Real-time upload progress indicators with percentage completion
- [ ] File type validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT only)
- [ ] File size validation (50MB maximum per file)
- [ ] Upload cancellation functionality
- [ ] File preview before upload confirmation
- [ ] Error handling for failed uploads with retry options

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: File validation logic and upload state management
- Integration tests: File upload flow with mocked backend responses
- Manual validation: Upload various file types and sizes

## System Stability
- Implement upload retry mechanism for transient failures
- Handle network interruptions gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for different failure scenarios

## Notes
- Consider implementing resumable uploads for large files
- Add file compression options for document optimization
- Plan for batch upload operations
