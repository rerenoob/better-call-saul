# Task: Responsive Mobile Design Implementation

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-005 React Frontend Development
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 5 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 05-react-frontend/003-dashboard-interface.md: Desktop interface baseline needed
- [x] 05-react-frontend/004-file-upload-interface.md: Upload interface for mobile adaptation

### External Dependencies
- Tailwind CSS responsive utilities
- Mobile device testing tools

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/layout/MobileNavigation.tsx`: Mobile navigation component
- `src/components/layout/ResponsiveLayout.tsx`: Responsive layout wrapper
- `src/components/mobile/MobileDashboard.tsx`: Mobile-optimized dashboard
- `src/components/mobile/MobileFileUpload.tsx`: Mobile file upload interface
- `src/hooks/useBreakpoint.ts`: Responsive breakpoint detection hook
- `src/styles/mobile.css`: Mobile-specific CSS overrides

### Code Patterns

- Use React hooks for responsive behavior detection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application works seamlessly on mobile devices (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Touch-friendly interface with appropriate button sizes (44px minimum)
- [ ] Mobile navigation with hamburger menu and slide-out drawer
- [ ] Responsive typography and spacing adjustments
- [ ] Mobile-optimized file upload with native file picker integration
- [ ] Dashboard layout adapts to portrait and landscape orientations
- [ ] Performance optimized for mobile devices (3G networks)
- [ ] Accessibility compliance for mobile screen readers

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Responsive hook behavior and component rendering
- Integration tests: Navigation and layout across different screen sizes
- Manual validation: Test on actual mobile devices and browser dev tools

## System Stability
- Implement progressive enhancement for mobile features
- Handle orientation changes gracefully
- Optimize image and asset loading for mobile bandwidth

## Notes
- Consider implementing offline functionality for mobile users
- Add touch gestures for common actions (swipe, pinch-to-zoom)
- Plan for Progressive Web App (PWA) features in future
