# Task: Local File Storage System Setup

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: Foundation Infrastructure (DEV-001 from 3_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Estimated Time**: 3 hours
- **Status**: Completed

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 002-logging-configuration.md: Logging needed for file operations

### External Dependencies
- Local file system access
- Directory permissions for web application

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `Services/IFileStorageService.cs`: File storage interface
- `Services/LocalFileStorageService.cs`: Local file storage implementation
- `appsettings.json`: File storage configuration paths
- `Program.cs`: Register file storage service
- `wwwroot/uploads/`: Create upload directory structure

### Code Patterns
- Follow repository pattern for file operations
- Implement proper file path sanitization
- Use async/await for file operations

### API/Data Structures
```csharp
public interface IFileStorageService
{
    Task<string> SaveFileAsync(IFormFile file, string directory);
    Task<bool> DeleteFileAsync(string filePath);
    Task<Stream> GetFileStreamAsync(string filePath);
    bool FileExists(string filePath);
}

public class FileStorageOptions
{
    public string BasePath { get; set; } = "wwwroot/uploads";
    public long MaxFileSize { get; set; } = 10_000_000; // 10MB
    public string[] AllowedExtensions { get; set; } = { ".pdf", ".docx" };
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Local file storage service implemented and registered
- [ ] Upload directory structure created with proper permissions
- [ ] File path sanitization prevents directory traversal
- [ ] File size and type validation implemented
- [ ] Temporary file cleanup mechanism in place
- [ ] Configuration allows easy path changes

## Testing Strategy
- Manual validation: Test file save/retrieve operations
- Security testing: Verify path sanitization works
- Configuration testing: Change base path and verify it works

## System Stability
- How this task maintains operational state: Provides secure file storage foundation
- Rollback strategy if needed: Remove service registration, delete upload directories
- Impact on existing functionality: None (foundation for document processing)
