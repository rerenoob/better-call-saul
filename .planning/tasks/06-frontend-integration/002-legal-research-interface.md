# Task: Legal Research Search and Results Interface

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-006 Frontend Integration and Document Handling
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 05-react-frontend/001-react-project-setup.md: React foundation needed
- [x] 04-legal-research/003-intelligent-case-matching.md: Case matching backend required
- [x] 04-legal-research/004-citation-management-system.md: Citation formatting needed

### External Dependencies
- Search UI libraries for advanced search interfaces
- Legal citation display components

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/research/LegalSearchInterface.tsx`: Main search component
- `src/components/research/SearchResults.tsx`: Search results display
- `src/components/research/CasePreview.tsx`: Individual case preview component
- `src/components/research/SearchFilters.tsx`: Advanced search filters
- `src/components/research/SavedResearch.tsx`: Saved research management
- `src/services/legalResearchService.ts`: Legal research API integration
- `src/types/research.ts`: Research-related type definitions

### Code Patterns
- Use debounced search input for performance optimization
- Implement infinite scrolling for large result sets
- Use virtualization for efficient rendering of many results

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Advanced search interface with multiple legal databases
- [ ] Search results with relevance scoring and sorting options
- [ ] Case preview with key information and legal citations
- [ ] Search result filtering by jurisdiction, date, court level
- [ ] Saved research functionality for organizing case law
- [ ] Export capabilities for research results (citations, full text)
- [ ] Search history and recently viewed cases
- [ ] Integration with case analysis for automatic research suggestions

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Search interface components and query building
- Integration tests: Search flow with legal database APIs
- Manual validation: Legal research workflow with known cases

## System Stability
- Implement search result caching for performance
- Handle API rate limits gracefully with user feedback
- Provide offline access to previously viewed research

## Notes
- Consider implementing search query suggestions and auto-complete
- Add legal citation validation and formatting
- Plan for advanced search operators and Boolean logic
