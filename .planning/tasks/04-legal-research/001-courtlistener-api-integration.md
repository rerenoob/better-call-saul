# Task: CourtListener API Integration

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-004 Legal Research Integration
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 5 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/001-dotnet-project-setup.md: API foundation needed
- [x] 03-ai-analysis/002-case-analysis-workflow.md: Analysis results needed for research

### External Dependencies
- CourtListener API access and authentication
- Legal citation parsing libraries

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Services/ICourtListenerService.cs`: CourtListener service interface
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/CourtListenerService.cs`: API implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/LegalCase.cs`: Legal case data model
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/CourtOpinion.cs`: Court opinion model
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Http/CourtListenerClient.cs`: HTTP client wrapper
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Controllers/LegalResearchController.cs`: Research endpoints

### Code Patterns
- Use HttpClient with proper timeout and retry policies
- Implement rate limiting to respect API quotas
- Use structured models for legal citation parsing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CourtListener API integration with authentication working
- [ ] Case law search by keywords, citations, and legal topics
- [ ] Court opinion retrieval with full text content
- [ ] Legal citation parsing and standardization
- [ ] Search result ranking and relevance scoring
- [ ] API rate limiting implemented (1000 requests/day limit)
- [ ] Error handling for API failures and rate limiting
- [ ] Response caching for frequently accessed cases

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: API client methods and response parsing
- Integration tests: Live API calls with test queries
- Manual validation: Search for known legal cases and verify results

## System Stability
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit exceeded errors
- Monitor API usage against quotas
- Provide fallback when service is unavailable

## Notes
- Consider upgrading to paid API tier for higher rate limits
- Implement search query optimization for better results
- Store frequently accessed cases in local cache
