# Task: Justia Legal Database Integration

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-004 Legal Research Integration
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 04-legal-research/001-courtlistener-api-integration.md: Similar API integration patterns
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/005-azure-services-integration.md: Azure services for caching

### External Dependencies
- Justia API access and documentation
- Legal database query optimization techniques

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Services/IJustiaService.cs`: Justia service interface
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/JustiaService.cs`: API implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/JustiaSearchResult.cs`: Search result model
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/LegalStatute.cs`: Legal statute model
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Http/JustiaClient.cs`: HTTP client implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/UnifiedLegalSearchService.cs`: Combined search service

### Code Patterns
- Follow similar patterns as CourtListener integration
- Implement adapter pattern for unified search interface
- Use async/await for all external API calls

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Justia API integration with search functionality
- [ ] Federal and state statute search capabilities
- [ ] Legal regulation and code search
- [ ] Cross-reference capabilities with case law from CourtListener
- [ ] Unified search interface combining multiple legal databases
- [ ] Search result deduplication across different sources
- [ ] Response time optimization through parallel API calls
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: API integration and response mapping
- Integration tests: Combined searches across multiple databases
- Manual validation: Legal research workflows with known statutes

## System Stability
- Implement circuit breaker for external API dependencies
- Monitor search response times and success rates
- Provide graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Notes
- Plan for additional legal database integrations (Westlaw, LexisNexis)
- Implement smart query routing based on content type
- Consider search result personalization based on jurisdiction
