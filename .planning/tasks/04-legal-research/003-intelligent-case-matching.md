# Task: Intelligent Case Law Matching Algorithm

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-004 Legal Research Integration
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 7 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 04-legal-research/001-courtlistener-api-integration.md: Legal database access needed
- [x] 03-ai-analysis/002-case-analysis-workflow.md: Case analysis results for matching
- [x] 03-ai-analysis/001-azure-openai-integration.md: AI services for semantic matching

### External Dependencies
- Legal text similarity algorithms
- Natural language processing libraries

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Services/ICaseMatchingService.cs`: Case matching interface
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/IntelligentCaseMatchingService.cs`: Matching implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/CaseMatch.cs`: Case match result model
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/ML/LegalTextSimilarity.cs`: Text similarity algorithms
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/MatchingCriteria.cs`: Matching criteria model
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Controllers/CaseMatchingController.cs`: Matching endpoints

### Code Patterns
- Use vector similarity for semantic matching
- Implement weighted scoring for different legal factors
- Use caching for expensive similarity calculations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Semantic similarity matching based on legal facts and issues
- [ ] Precedent relevance scoring with confidence metrics
- [ ] Jurisdiction-aware matching (federal vs. state vs. local)
- [ ] Legal issue categorization and matching
- [ ] Similar case identification with reasoning explanation
- [ ] Match quality scoring and ranking algorithm
- [ ] Real-time matching with sub-30 second response times
- [ ] Historical match accuracy tracking and improvement

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Similarity algorithms with known legal text pairs
- Integration tests: End-to-end case matching workflow
- Manual validation: Legal expert review of match quality and relevance

## System Stability
- Implement result caching for expensive matching operations
- Monitor matching algorithm performance and accuracy
- Provide fallback to simpler keyword matching if AI services fail

## Notes
- Consider machine learning model training for improved matching
- Implement feedback mechanism to improve matching over time
- Plan for different matching strategies based on case type
