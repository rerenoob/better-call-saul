# Task: Create Mock Service Test Suite

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: AZURE-06 Test Suite Updates (`.planning/3_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 001-mock-ai-service.md: Mock AI service implemented
- [x] 002-local-file-storage-service.md: Local file storage service implemented
- [x] 001-azure-test-removal.md: Azure tests removed to avoid conflicts

### External Dependencies
- Mock service implementations completed
- Test framework and existing test patterns

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create
- `BetterCallSaul.Tests/Services/AI/MockAIServiceTests.cs`: Comprehensive tests for mock AI service
- `BetterCallSaul.Tests/Services/FileProcessing/LocalFileStorageServiceTests.cs`: Tests for local storage
- `BetterCallSaul.Tests/Integration/MockServiceIntegrationTests.cs`: Integration tests for mock services

### Code Patterns
- Follow existing test patterns in `BetterCallSaul.Tests/Services/` directory
- Use MSTest framework (existing project standard)
- Mock external dependencies using existing mocking patterns
- Test all interface contract requirements

### Mock AI Service Test Coverage
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class MockAIServiceTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task AnalyzeCaseAsync_ValidRequest_ReturnsRealisticResponse()
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task AnalyzeCaseAsync_LargeDocument_SimulatesRealisticDelay()
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task GenerateLegalAnalysisAsync_ValidInput_ReturnsLegalAnalysis()
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task StreamAnalysisAsync_ValidRequest_YieldsIncrementalUpdates()
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task PredictCaseOutcomeAsync_InvalidInput_HandlesGracefully()
}
```

### Local Storage Service Test Coverage
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class LocalFileStorageServiceTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task UploadFileAsync_ValidFile_SavesFileLocally()
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task DownloadFileAsync_ExistingFile_ReturnsFileStream()
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task DeleteFileAsync_ExistingFile_RemovesFile()
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task UploadFileAsync_DuplicateFileName_HandlesConflict()
}
```

### Integration Test Coverage
- Service resolution works correctly in development environment
- Mock services integrate properly with existing controllers
- File upload/download workflows work end-to-end
- AI analysis workflows complete successfully with mock responses

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for MockAIService covering all IAIService methods
- [ ] Complete unit tests for LocalFileStorageService covering all IStorageService methods
- [ ] Integration tests validating mock service registration and resolution
- [ ] All tests pass consistently and independently
- [ ] Test coverage for error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Performance tests for simulated delays in mock services
- [ ] Integration tests for controller endpoints using mock services
- [ ] Test data and fixtures support realistic testing scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Isolate and test individual mock service methods
- Integration tests: Validate service interactions and dependency injection
- Manual validation:
  1. Run new test suite and verify all tests pass
  2. Check test coverage reports for adequate coverage
  3. Validate tests execute within reasonable time bounds

## System Stability
- How this task maintains operational state: Provides test coverage for new mock services
- Rollback strategy if needed: Remove failing tests and debug mock service implementations
- Impact on existing functionality: Improves test coverage for development environment

## Test Data and Fixtures

### Mock AI Test Data
- Sample legal documents of varying complexity
- Different case types (criminal, civil, appeals)
- Edge cases (empty documents, very large documents)
- Various request parameters and configurations

### Local Storage Test Data
- Different file types (PDF, DOC, TXT, images)
- Various file sizes (small, medium, large)
- File naming scenarios (special characters, long names)
- Directory structure validation

### Performance Test Scenarios
- Mock AI response time validation (1-3 seconds)
- File storage operation performance
- Concurrent operation handling
- Memory usage during large file operations

## Quality Assurance
- Tests should be deterministic and repeatable
- Mock services should provide consistent responses for identical inputs
- Error handling tests should validate appropriate exception types
- Integration tests should not depend on external services

## Notes
- Mock service tests replace Azure service tests in terms of coverage
- Tests should validate that mock services fulfill interface contracts
- Consider adding performance benchmarks for mock service operations
- Ensure tests provide confidence in development environment functionality
