# Task: Backend Unit and Integration Test Suite

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-007 Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/003-jwt-authentication-setup.md: Authentication logic to test
- [x] 03-ai-analysis/002-case-analysis-workflow.md: AI analysis logic to test
- [x] 02-file-processing/003-ocr-text-extraction.md: File processing logic to test

### External Dependencies
- xUnit testing framework for .NET
- Test database setup and seeding
- Mock frameworks for external dependencies

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Tests.Unit/Services/CaseAnalysisServiceTests.cs`: AI analysis unit tests
- `BetterCallSaul.Tests.Unit/Services/AuthenticationServiceTests.cs`: Auth service unit tests
- `BetterCallSaul.Tests.Integration/Controllers/FileUploadControllerTests.cs`: File upload integration tests
- `BetterCallSaul.Tests.Integration/Data/DatabaseIntegrationTests.cs`: Database integration tests
- `BetterCallSaul.Tests.Integration/TestFixtures/WebApplicationFactory.cs`: Test application factory
- `BetterCallSaul.Tests.Common/TestData/`: Test data and fixtures

### Code Patterns
- Use xUnit with proper test organization and naming conventions
- Implement test database with Docker for consistent environments
- Use builder pattern for test data creation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit test coverage exceeds 85% for business-critical logic
- [ ] Authentication and authorization logic fully tested
- [ ] AI analysis service tested with mocked OpenAI responses
- [ ] File upload and processing pipeline tested end-to-end
- [ ] Database operations tested with realistic data scenarios
- [ ] External API integrations tested with mocked responses
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases covered in tests
- [ ] Test execution time under 5 minutes for full suite

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Individual service and component testing in isolation
- Integration tests: Cross-component interactions and database operations
- Manual validation: Test runner execution and coverage reporting

## System Stability
- Implement test database cleanup between test runs
- Use test containers for consistent external dependencies
- Monitor test execution performance and flaky test identification

## Notes
- Consider implementing mutation testing for test quality assessment
- Set up continuous integration test execution
- Plan for load testing infrastructure in separate tasks
