# Task: Performance Testing and Load Testing

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-007 Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 07-testing-qa/001-backend-unit-integration-tests.md: Backend testing foundation needed
- [x] 06-frontend-integration/001-ai-analysis-display.md: AI analysis performance to test

### External Dependencies
- K6 or Apache JMeter for load testing
- Performance monitoring tools and APM solutions
- Load testing infrastructure and environments

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `performance-tests/load-test-scenarios.js`: K6 load testing scenarios
- `performance-tests/api-performance-tests.js`: API endpoint performance tests
- `performance-tests/file-upload-load-tests.js`: File upload performance tests
- `performance-tests/ai-analysis-performance-tests.js`: AI analysis load tests
- `performance-tests/database-performance-tests.sql`: Database performance queries
- `docs/performance-test-results.md`: Performance testing documentation

### Code Patterns
- Use K6 for JavaScript-based load testing scenarios
- Implement gradual load ramp-up for realistic testing
- Use performance monitoring and profiling tools

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API response times under 200ms for standard operations
- [ ] File upload performance handles 10MB files within 30 seconds
- [ ] AI analysis completes within 5 minutes under normal load
- [ ] System handles 100 concurrent users without degradation
- [ ] Database queries optimized for sub-100ms response times
- [ ] Frontend load times under 2 seconds on 3G networks
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under sustained load
- [ ] Auto-scaling triggers work correctly under load

## Testing Strategy
- Load testing: Simulate expected user traffic and usage patterns
- Stress testing: Test system limits and failure modes
- Manual validation: Performance monitoring during test execution

## System Stability
- Implement performance baselines and regression detection
- Monitor system resources during load testing
- Set up performance alerting for production deployment

## Notes
- Consider implementing chaos engineering for resilience testing
- Plan for CDN and caching strategy optimization
- Set up continuous performance monitoring in production
