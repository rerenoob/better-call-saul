# Task: Security Testing and Penetration Testing

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-007 Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/003-jwt-authentication-setup.md: Authentication security to test
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/004-cors-and-security-middleware.md: Security middleware to test
- [x] 02-file-processing/002-virus-scanning-validation.md: File security to test

### External Dependencies
- OWASP ZAP or similar security testing tools
- Security scanning libraries and vulnerability databases
- Penetration testing methodology and checklists

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `security-tests/owasp-zap-baseline.yml`: Automated security scanning configuration
- `security-tests/authentication-security-tests.cs`: Authentication security test suite
- `security-tests/file-upload-security-tests.cs`: File upload security tests
- `security-tests/api-security-tests.cs`: API endpoint security tests
- `security-tests/data-protection-tests.cs`: Data encryption and privacy tests
- `docs/security-test-results.md`: Security testing documentation

### Code Patterns
- Use OWASP Top 10 as security testing framework
- Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Use security testing libraries for common vulnerability checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Authentication bypass attempts fail appropriately
- [ ] SQL injection and XSS vulnerability testing passes
- [ ] File upload security prevents malicious file execution
- [ ] API rate limiting and DDoS protection tested
- [ ] Data encryption at rest and in transit verified
- [ ] Session management and token security validated
- [ ] CORS configuration tested for proper restrictions
- [ ] No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities identified

## Testing Strategy
- Automated security scanning: Regular vulnerability assessment
- Manual penetration testing: Human expert security evaluation
- Manual validation: Security compliance checklist verification

## System Stability
- Implement security monitoring and alerting
- Regular security updates and patch management
- Incident response procedures for security issues

## Notes
- Consider third-party security audit for comprehensive assessment
- Implement security headers and content security policies
- Plan for ongoing security monitoring and threat detection
