# Task: Frontend Component and Integration Testing

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-007 Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 05-react-frontend/003-dashboard-interface.md: Dashboard components to test
- [x] 05-react-frontend/004-file-upload-interface.md: Upload components to test
- [x] 06-frontend-integration/001-ai-analysis-display.md: Analysis components to test

### External Dependencies
- Vitest or Jest testing framework
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock service worker for API mocking

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/__tests__/Dashboard.test.tsx`: Dashboard component tests
- `src/components/__tests__/FileUploader.test.tsx`: File upload component tests
- `src/components/__tests__/AnalysisResults.test.tsx`: Analysis display tests
- `src/services/__tests__/authService.test.ts`: Authentication service tests
- `src/hooks/__tests__/useAuth.test.ts`: Authentication hook tests
- `src/utils/test-utils.tsx`: Testing utility functions and providers

### Code Patterns
- Use React Testing Library for user-centric testing approaches
- Implement custom render functions with providers
- Use Mock Service Worker for realistic API mocking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Component rendering tests for all major UI components
- [ ] User interaction testing (clicks, form submissions, navigation)
- [ ] Authentication flow testing with mocked API responses
- [ ] File upload workflow testing with progress tracking
- [ ] Real-time update testing with SignalR mocked connections
- [ ] Responsive design testing across different viewport sizes
- [ ] Accessibility testing with screen reader simulation
- [ ] Error state and loading state testing for all components

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Individual component behavior and props handling
- Integration tests: Component interactions and state management
- Manual validation: Test execution in different browsers

## System Stability
- Implement test data factories for consistent test scenarios
- Use snapshot testing judiciously for UI regression detection
- Monitor test execution performance and maintenance overhead

## Notes
- Consider implementing visual regression testing with tools like Chromatic
- Set up accessibility testing automation
- Plan for end-to-end testing in separate tasks
