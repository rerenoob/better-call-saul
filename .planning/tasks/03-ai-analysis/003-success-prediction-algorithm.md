# Task: Success Prediction Algorithm Development

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-003 AI Analysis Engine
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 03-ai-analysis/002-case-analysis-workflow.md: Case analysis foundation needed
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/002-database-schema-design.md: Data storage required

### External Dependencies
- Historical case outcome data (if available)
- Legal expertise for prediction model validation

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Services/ISuccessPredictionService.cs`: Prediction service interface
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/SuccessPredictionService.cs`: Prediction implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/SuccessPrediction.cs`: Prediction result model
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/PredictionFactors.cs`: Factors influencing prediction
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/ML/PredictionPrompts.cs`: ML-focused prompts
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Controllers/PredictionController.cs`: Prediction endpoints

### Code Patterns
- Use structured prompting for consistent prediction outputs
- Implement factor-based analysis for explainable predictions
- Use statistical validation for prediction confidence

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Success probability score (0-100%) with confidence intervals
- [ ] Key factors contributing to prediction identified and weighted
- [ ] Risk assessment including potential negative outcomes
- [ ] Recommendation engine for case strategy optimization
- [ ] Historical comparison with similar case patterns
- [ ] Prediction rationale clearly explained for legal professionals
- [ ] Model performance tracking and accuracy metrics
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis for different scenario variations

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Prediction algorithm logic and factor weighting
- Integration tests: End-to-end prediction workflow
- Manual validation: Compare predictions with legal expert assessments

## System Stability
- Implement prediction result validation and sanity checks
- Monitor prediction accuracy over time with feedback loops
- Handle edge cases where prediction confidence is low

## Notes
- Consider ensemble approach combining multiple prediction methods
- Implement feedback mechanism to improve predictions over time
- Ensure predictions include appropriate disclaimers for legal use
