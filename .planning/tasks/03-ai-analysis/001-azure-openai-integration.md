# Task: Azure OpenAI Service Integration

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-003 AI Analysis Engine
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 5 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/005-azure-services-integration.md: Azure services foundation needed
- [x] 02-file-processing/003-ocr-text-extraction.md: Extracted text required for analysis

### External Dependencies
- Azure OpenAI Service provisioning
- GPT-4 model deployment and API access

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Services/IAzureOpenAIService.cs`: OpenAI service interface
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/AzureOpenAIService.cs`: OpenAI implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/AIRequest.cs`: AI analysis request model
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/AIResponse.cs`: AI analysis response model
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Configuration/OpenAIOptions.cs`: Configuration model
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Program.cs`: Register OpenAI services

### Code Patterns
- Use Azure OpenAI SDK with proper authentication
- Implement retry policies with exponential backoff
- Use structured prompts for consistent AI responses

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Azure OpenAI service successfully deployed and accessible
- [ ] API integration with proper authentication using managed identity
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented to stay within API quotas
- [ ] Error handling for API failures and timeouts
- [ ] Response streaming for long-running analysis operations
- [ ] Cost tracking and monitoring for API usage
- [ ] Prompt engineering templates for legal analysis
- [ ] Response validation and safety checks

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: API client initialization and request formatting
- Integration tests: Actual OpenAI API calls with test data
- Manual validation: Submit sample legal documents for analysis

## System Stability
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for API failures
- Monitor API response times and success rates
- Set up alerting for quota exhaustion or service issues

## Notes
- Use GPT-4 model for higher accuracy in legal analysis
- Implement prompt templates for different analysis types
- Plan for model version updates and migration strategies
