# Task: Data Anonymization and Privacy Protection

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-003 AI Analysis Engine
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [x] 03-ai-analysis/002-case-analysis-workflow.md: Analysis workflow needed
- [x] 01-backend-infrastructure/002-database-schema-design.md: Data models required

### External Dependencies
- Legal compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, attorney-client privilege)
- Data anonymization libraries and techniques

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Services/IDataAnonymizationService.cs`: Anonymization interface
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/DataAnonymizationService.cs`: Implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Models/AnonymizedData.cs`: Anonymized data model
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Privacy/PIIDetector.cs`: PII detection logic
- `BetterCallSaul.Core/Configuration/PrivacyOptions.cs`: Privacy configuration
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Middleware/DataPrivacyMiddleware.cs`: Privacy enforcement

### Code Patterns
- Use regular expressions and NLP for PII detection
- Implement reversible anonymization with secure key management
- Follow privacy-by-design principles throughout the system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Personal identifiers (names, addresses, SSNs) automatically detected and redacted
- [ ] Sensitive information anonymized before AI processing
- [ ] Anonymization reversible for authorized users with proper authentication
- [ ] Audit trail for all anonymization and de-anonymization operations
- [ ] GDPR compliance for EU data subjects
- [ ] Attorney-client privilege protection maintained
- [ ] Data retention policies enforced automatically
- [ ] Privacy impact assessment completed and documented

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: PII detection accuracy with various document types
- Integration tests: End-to-end anonymization workflow
- Manual validation: Legal review of anonymization effectiveness

## System Stability
- Implement fail-safe defaults (anonymize when uncertain)
- Monitor anonymization effectiveness with regular audits
- Provide clear privacy controls for users and administrators

## Notes
- Consider differential privacy techniques for statistical analysis
- Implement data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure)
- Regular review and update of PII detection patterns
