## Critical Path Analysis

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)
**Sequential Dependencies - Must complete in order**
1. `01-service-architecture/001-di-container-refactor.md` (4h)
2. `01-service-architecture/002-environment-service-validation.md` (2h)

### Phase 2: Azure Removal (Day 2)
**Sequential Dependencies - Must complete after Phase 1**
1. `02-azure-code-removal/001-azure-service-implementations.md` (4h)
2. `02-azure-code-removal/002-azure-configuration-classes.md` (3h)
3. `02-azure-code-removal/003-nuget-package-cleanup.md` (1h)

### Phase 3: Service Implementation (Day 3)
**Parallel Work - Can work simultaneously**
- `03-mock-services/001-mock-ai-service.md` (3h)
- `03-mock-services/002-local-file-storage-service.md` (3h)
- `04-configuration/001-appsettings-cleanup.md` (2h)
- `04-configuration/002-aws-configuration-validation.md` (2h)

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Days 4-5)
**Sequential Dependencies - Build on previous phases**
1. `05-testing-validation/001-azure-test-removal.md` (2h)
2. `05-testing-validation/002-mock-service-tests.md` (4h)
3. `05-testing-validation/003-environment-integration-tests.md` (3h)
4. `05-testing-validation/004-documentation-updates.md` (3h)
5. `05-testing-validation/005-final-system-validation.md` (4h)

## Integration Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Service Architecture Complete
**After Phase 1 completion**
- ✅ DI container refactored for environment-based service selection
- ✅ Service resolution validated in both development and production
- ✅ Application starts successfully with new service pattern

**Validation Criteria:**
- Development environment resolves to mock services
- Production environment resolves to AWS services
- No runtime provider switching logic remains
- All existing service interfaces preserved

### Checkpoint 2: Azure Code Eliminated
**After Phase 2 completion**
- ✅ All Azure service implementations removed
- ✅ All Azure configuration classes removed
- ✅ Azure NuGet packages removed
- ✅ Build succeeds without Azure dependencies

**Validation Criteria:**
- No Azure code references remain in codebase
- Application builds successfully
- No Azure imports or using statements remain
- Git history preserves deleted files for rollback

### Checkpoint 3: Mock Services Operational
**After Phase 3 completion**
- ✅ Mock services implemented and functional
- ✅ Local file storage working
- ✅ Configuration simplified
- ✅ AWS configuration validated for production

**Validation Criteria:**
- Development environment works without cloud configuration
- Mock services provide realistic responses and delays
- Configuration files cleaned of Azure sections
- AWS production configuration properly documented

### Checkpoint 4: Quality Assurance Complete
**After Phase 4 completion**
- ✅ All tests updated and passing
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Final system validation complete
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

**Validation Criteria:**
- All tests pass consistently
- No reduction in test coverage
- Documentation accurately reflects new architecture
- Performance within acceptable bounds

## Parallel Work Opportunities

### Day 3 - Phase 3 Parallelization
**Team Member A:**
- Mock AI Service implementation
- Mock AI Service testing

**Team Member B:**
- Local File Storage Service implementation
- Configuration cleanup

**Team Member C:**
- AWS configuration validation
- Documentation preparation

### Quality Gates

Each checkpoint includes specific quality gates that must be met before proceeding:

1. **Build Verification**: Application builds successfully
2. **Test Execution**: Existing tests continue to pass
3. **Functionality Check**: Core features remain operational
4. **Performance Baseline**: No significant performance degradation

## Risk Mitigation Checkpoints

### After Each Phase
- **Commit Changes**: Ensure clean git state for rollback
- **Run Test Suite**: Validate no functionality broken
- **Performance Check**: Baseline performance maintained
- **Documentation Update**: Keep documentation current

### Emergency Rollback Points
- After Phase 1: Can rollback DI changes if service resolution fails
- After Phase 2: Can restore Azure code if critical functionality broken
- After Phase 3: Can revert to previous service implementations
- After Phase 4: Complete system rollback if validation fails

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Code Complexity**: 30% reduction in service registration complexity
- **Dependencies**: 3 fewer NuGet packages (Azure packages removed)
- **Configuration**: 50% reduction in configuration sections
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >80% test coverage

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified local development setup
- **Maintainability**: Single code path for each service type
- **Documentation Quality**: Clear, actionable setup instructions
- **System Reliability**: Consistent behavior across environments
