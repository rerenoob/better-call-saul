## MVP Critical Path
1. DEV-001 → AUTH-002 → DOC-003 → CASE-004 → AI-005 → UI-006 → TEST-007

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- **UI components** can be developed alongside backend tasks (Tasks 4-5)
- **User research** can happen parallel to development
- **Sample document preparation** can happen during Task 1-2

## MVP Implementation Approach

### Week 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-2)
- Local development environment
- Basic authentication system

### Week 2-3: Core Features (Tasks 3-4)
- Document upload and text extraction
- Simple case management

### Week 4-5: AI Integration & UI (Tasks 5-6)
- Azure OpenAI integration
- Responsive user interface

### Week 6: Testing & Polish (Task 7)
- End-to-end testing
- Bug fixes and deployment prep

**Total MVP Timeline: 6 weeks**

### MVP Technical Considerations
- Keep data models simple but extensible for Phase 2
- Implement basic logging for debugging
- Use sample/test documents only (no production data)
- Focus on working functionality over perfect code
- Document decisions for Phase 2 planning

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Set up development environment (Task 1)
2. **Week 1**: Begin authentication system implementation
3. **Week 2**: Start document processing development
4. **Ongoing**: Conduct user research parallel to development
5. **Week 4**: Begin planning Phase 2 based on MVP learnings

## Phase 2 Deferred Features
- Legal database integration
- Advanced AI analysis with confidence scoring
- Workflow optimization tools
- Enterprise security and compliance
- Cloud deployment and scaling
- Advanced document processing (OCR, complex formats)
