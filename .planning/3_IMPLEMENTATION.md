## Critical Path Analysis

**Sequential Dependencies:**
1. AZURE-01 (Service Architecture) → AZURE-02 (Azure Removal) → AZURE-03 (Mock Services)
2. AZURE-02 → AZURE-04 (Configuration) → AZURE-05 (Dependencies)
3. All implementation tasks → AZURE-06 (Tests) → AZURE-07 (Documentation) → AZURE-08 (Validation)

**Parallel Work Opportunities:**
- AZURE-04 (Configuration) and AZURE-05 (Dependencies) can run parallel to AZURE-03 (Mock Services)
- AZURE-07 (Documentation) can begin once implementation tasks complete
- Test updates (AZURE-06) can begin as soon as service architecture changes are complete

**Estimated Total Time:** 33-44 hours (approximately 4-5 working days)

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Service Interface Changes**: Risk of breaking API contracts
   - Mitigation: Preserve all existing interfaces, only change implementations

2. **Data Access Issues**: Risk of breaking existing file access
   - Mitigation: Document data migration requirements, test file operations thoroughly

3. **Environment Configuration**: Risk of production deployment issues
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing in staging environment, clear deployment guides

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Risk of missing functionality in simplified architecture
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test review and execution

2. **Performance Degradation**: Risk of slower responses with local services
   - Mitigation: Performance benchmarking and optimization

## Next Steps

1. Begin with AZURE-01 (Service Architecture Simplification)
2. Set up development environment for testing changes
3. Create feature branch for Azure removal work
4. Execute tasks in dependency order
5. Regular testing and validation at each phase
