# Architecture Decisions - Better Call Saul AI Legal Assistant

**Created:** August 31, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

## Decision 1: Blazor Server Architecture

### Context
Need to build a responsive, interactive legal application with real-time AI analysis capabilities and secure document handling.

### Options Considered
1. **Blazor Server**: Real-time interactivity, .NET ecosystem, easier state management
2. **Blazor WebAssembly**: Client-side execution, offline capabilities, larger initial download
3. **React/Vue + .NET API**: Frontend flexibility, separate deployment, more complex setup
4. **Traditional MVC**: Simpler architecture, less real-time capability

### Chosen Solution
**Blazor Server** with .NET 8 backend

### Rationale
- **Real-time requirements**: Legal analysis needs immediate feedback and updates
- **.NET ecosystem**: Leverages existing .NET skills and libraries
- **State management**: Built-in state handling for complex legal workflows
- **Security**: Server-side execution protects sensitive legal data
- **Development speed**: Rapid prototyping and iteration capabilities

## Decision 2: Generative AI Integration Approach

### Context
Need to integrate Generative AI capabilities for natural language case analysis and legal reasoning while maintaining security and compliance.

### Options Considered
1. **External LLM APIs**: Quick integration, data privacy concerns, limited control
2. **Self-hosted LLMs**: Full control, better compliance, higher infrastructure cost
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Sensitive data with self-hosted models, general analysis with external APIs

### Chosen Solution
**Hybrid Approach** with self-hosted legal-domain LLMs for sensitive data and external APIs for general analysis

### Rationale
- **Data privacy**: Sensitive legal data processed by self-hosted models
- **Legal specificity**: Domain-specific fine-tuning for legal reasoning
- **Cost efficiency**: Balance between control and operational costs
- **Compliance**: Meet legal industry data protection requirements

## Decision 3: Document Processing Strategy

### Context
Need to handle various legal document formats with high accuracy and security.

### Options Considered
1. **Built-in libraries**: iTextSharp, DocX, etc. - full control, maintenance burden
2. **Cloud services**: Azure Form Recognizer, AWS Textract - managed service, cost
3. **Hybrid**: Core extraction built-in, advanced features via services

### Chosen Solution
**Hybrid approach** with core document processing built-in and advanced AI features via Azure Form Recognizer

### Rationale
- **Cost control**: Basic extraction handled locally, pay for advanced features
- **Accuracy**: Professional services provide better OCR and extraction
- **Scalability**: Cloud services handle peak loads
- **Maintenance**: Reduced operational overhead

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: .NET 8 with Blazor Server
- **Database**: SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
- **Generative AI**: Self-hosted legal LLMs, Azure OpenAI for general analysis
- **Document Processing**: iTextSharp (basic), Azure Form Recognizer (advanced)
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage for documents

### Frontend
- **UI Framework**: Blazor Components
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5 + Custom CSS
- **Charts**: Chart.js or similar for data visualization
- **File Upload**: Blazor file upload components

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Azure App Service
- **Database**: Azure SQL Database
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage
- **AI Services**: Azure OpenAI, self-hosted LLM infrastructure
- **Security**: Azure Active Directory integration

### Integration APIs
- **Legal Databases**: REST APIs (specific TBD)
- **Authentication**: OAuth2/OIDC for organizational integration
- **Document Processing**: Azure Form Recognizer API

## Standard Patterns

Using established patterns from existing codebase:
- Razor component architecture
- Bootstrap styling framework
- .NET dependency injection
- Repository pattern for data access
- Clean separation of concerns

## Next Steps
1. Finalize specific Azure service configurations
2. Define legal database API integration specifications
3. Establish document processing pipeline architecture
4. Develop security and compliance implementation plan
