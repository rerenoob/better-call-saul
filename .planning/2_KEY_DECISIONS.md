# Architecture Decisions - Better Call Saul

**Created:** September 4, 2025  
**Version:** 1.1 - Updated Frontend Architecture

## Decision 1: AI Processing Architecture

### Context
The application requires AI-powered case analysis and legal research capabilities. We need to decide between cloud-based AI services vs. on-premise AI models, considering performance, cost, security, and compliance requirements.

### Options Considered
1. **Cloud AI Services (OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services)**
   - Pros: No infrastructure overhead, regular model updates, high availability
   - Cons: Data residency concerns, API costs, external dependency
   
2. **On-Premise AI Models (Local deployment)**
   - Pros: Full data control, no recurring API costs, offline capability
   - Cons: High infrastructure costs, model maintenance burden, limited model sophistication
   
3. **Hybrid Approach (Sensitive data local, research cloud-based)**
   - Pros: Balance of control and capability, compliance flexibility
   - Cons: Increased complexity, dual maintenance overhead

### Decision: Cloud AI Services with Data Privacy Controls

**Rationale:**
- Legal document analysis requires sophisticated NLP capabilities best provided by cloud AI services
- Azure Cognitive Services offers GDPR compliance and data residency controls suitable for legal applications
- Cost-effectiveness for MVP development with pay-per-use scaling
- Existing .NET 8 application integrates seamlessly with Azure services
- Document processing can be done with data anonymization to protect client confidentiality

**Technical Implementation:**
- Azure OpenAI Service for case analysis and summarization
- Azure Form Recognizer for document processing and OCR
- Data anonymization layer before AI processing
- On-premise temporary storage for document processing pipeline

## Decision 2: Legal Database Integration Strategy

### Context
The application needs access to legal databases for case law research and precedent matching. Options range from expensive commercial databases to free public resources.

### Options Considered
1. **Commercial Legal Databases (Westlaw, LexisNexis)**
   - Pros: Comprehensive coverage, high-quality metadata, established APIs
   - Cons: Very expensive, complex licensing, potential vendor lock-in
   
2. **Public Legal Databases (Justia, CourtListener, Google Scholar)**
   - Pros: Free or low-cost, good coverage of case law, open APIs
   - Cons: Inconsistent metadata quality, limited advanced search features
   
3. **Hybrid Approach (Primary free, premium commercial for complex cases)**
   - Pros: Cost-effective for MVP, upgrade path for advanced features
   - Cons: Inconsistent user experience, complex integration

### Decision: Start with Public Databases, Enable Commercial Integration

**Rationale:**
- MVP can demonstrate value using free databases like CourtListener and Justia
- Public defender offices have limited budgets, making free options essential
- Architecture designed to support multiple database sources
- Commercial database integration can be added post-MVP based on user demand
- Focuses initial development on AI analysis capabilities rather than database licensing costs

**Technical Implementation:**
- RESTful API wrapper for multiple legal database sources
- Standardized search interface abstracting underlying database differences
- Caching layer for frequently accessed cases and statutes
- Plugin architecture for adding commercial database integrations

## Decision 3: File Processing and Security Architecture

### Context
Legal documents contain highly sensitive information requiring secure handling, processing, and storage. Must balance security requirements with performance and usability needs.

### Options Considered
1. **Client-Side Processing (Browser-based file analysis)**
   - Pros: No server-side sensitive data storage, reduced infrastructure costs
   - Cons: Limited processing power, JavaScript security limitations, poor mobile experience
   
2. **Server-Side Processing with Temporary Storage**
   - Pros: Full processing capabilities, better security controls, consistent performance
   - Cons: Server-side sensitive data handling, storage compliance requirements
   
3. **Serverless Processing Pipeline (Azure Functions, AWS Lambda)**
   - Pros: Automatic scaling, pay-per-use, isolated processing environments
   - Cons: Cold start latency, vendor lock-in, complex debugging

### Decision: Server-Side Processing with Enhanced Security Controls

**Rationale:**
- Legal documents require sophisticated processing beyond browser capabilities
- .NET 8 Web API backend provides secure server-side processing with comprehensive security controls
- Can implement encryption at rest and in transit with modern API architecture
- Better performance and user experience with dedicated frontend framework
- Compliance with legal industry security standards easier to achieve with API-based architecture

**Technical Implementation:**
- Encrypted file upload with virus scanning
- Temporary encrypted storage with automatic purging (24-hour retention max)
- Role-based access control with audit logging
- Data anonymization before AI processing
- End-to-end encryption for all file transfers
- Secure document viewer with watermarking and print restrictions

## Decision 4: Frontend Architecture and Technology Stack

### Context
Legal professionals require a highly responsive, intuitive user interface that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. The application must provide excellent user experience while maintaining security and performance.

### Options Considered
1. **Blazor Server (Original Choice)**
   - Pros: Integrated with .NET ecosystem, server-side security, minimal JavaScript
   - Cons: Limited UI flexibility, poor mobile experience, server-side rendering latency
   
2. **React with TypeScript**
   - Pros: Excellent user experience, mobile-responsive, large ecosystem, strong typing
   - Cons: Additional complexity, separate frontend/backend deployment
   
3. **Angular with TypeScript**
   - Pros: Enterprise-ready, comprehensive framework, strong typing
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve, heavier framework, over-engineered for MVP

### Decision: React with TypeScript Frontend + .NET 8 Web API Backend

**Rationale:**
- Legal professionals need responsive, modern UI that works well on tablets and mobile devices
- React provides superior user experience with smooth interactions and real-time updates
- TypeScript ensures type safety and maintainability for complex legal workflows
- Separation of concerns allows independent scaling and deployment of frontend/backend
- Large React ecosystem provides excellent components for data visualization and document handling
- API-first architecture enables future integrations with other legal software

**Technical Implementation:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe frontend development
- .NET 8 Web API for secure backend services and business logic
- JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
