# Product Requirements Document: Cloud-Agnostic Migration
*Created: 2025-09-14*

## Overview

### Problem Statement
The Better Call Saul application is currently tightly coupled to Azure services (OpenAI, Blob Storage, Form Recognizer), creating vendor lock-in and limiting deployment flexibility. Organizations need the ability to deploy to AWS, Google Cloud, or on-premises environments while maintaining the same functionality.

### Feature Summary
Migrate the Better Call Saul AI Lawyer application from Azure-specific services to a cloud-agnostic architecture that supports multiple cloud providers through configurable service abstractions.

### Goals
1. **Provider Flexibility**: Enable deployment on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or hybrid environments
2. **Service Abstraction**: Create unified interfaces for AI, storage, and document processing services
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Switch between providers using environment variables only
4. **Feature Parity**: Maintain all existing functionality across different cloud providers
5. **AWS-Ready**: Specifically ensure production-ready deployment on AWS

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Application deploys successfully on AWS with full functionality
- ✅ Zero code changes required to switch between cloud providers
- ✅ All existing features work identically across providers
- ✅ Performance remains within 10% of current Azure implementation
- ✅ Deployment time reduced by 20% through provider choice flexibility

## User Experience

### Deployment Flow
1. **Provider Selection**: Configure cloud provider via environment variables
2. **Service Configuration**: Set provider-specific endpoints and credentials
3. **Validation**: System validates configuration and connectivity on startup
4. **Runtime**: Application operates identically regardless of provider

### Administrative Experience
- Configuration changes require only environment variable updates
- Real-time provider switching for disaster recovery scenarios
- Unified monitoring and logging across all providers
- Cost optimization through provider comparison tools

## Acceptance Criteria

### Provider Support
- [ ] AWS deployment with Bedrock, S3, and Textract
- [ ] Azure deployment (current functionality maintained)
- [ ] Google Cloud deployment with Vertex AI, Cloud Storage, Document AI
- [ ] Local/development deployment with mock services
- [ ] Hybrid deployments (e.g., AWS compute + Azure AI)

### Feature Compatibility
- [ ] All existing API endpoints function identically
- [ ] Case analysis produces equivalent results across providers
- [ ] File upload/download works seamlessly

- [ ] Zero-downtime provider switching for supported scenarios
- [ ] Comprehensive health checks for all services
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline validates all provider combinations

## Open Questions ⚠️

### Technical Uncertainties
- **Q1**: How should we handle provider-specific AI model differences (e.g., token limits, context windows)?
- **Q2**: Should we implement automatic provider failover or require manual configuration?
- **Q3**: How do we normalize confidence scores across different document processing services?
- **Q4**: What's the approach for handling provider-specific features not available elsewhere?

### Business Decisions
- **Q5**: Which cloud providers should be prioritized for initial implementation?
- **Q6**: Should we maintain separate deployment templates for each provider?
- **Q7**: How do we handle cost optimization recommendations across providers?
- **Q8**: What's the strategy for provider-specific performance optimizations?

### Operational Concerns
- **Q9**: How do we manage secrets across multiple cloud providers?
- **Q10**: Should monitoring and logging be provider-specific or unified?
- **Q11**: What's the disaster recovery strategy for provider outages?
- **Q12**: How do we handle data residency requirements across regions?

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Cloud provider SDKs (AWS SDK, Azure SDK, Google Cloud SDK)
- Provider-specific AI service access (API keys, service accounts)
- Container orchestration platform (Kubernetes, Docker, cloud-native)
- Secrets management system (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)

### Internal Dependencies
- Database migration strategy for provider-specific metadata
- Frontend configuration updates for provider-specific endpoints
- DevOps pipeline updates for multi-provider deployments
- Testing infrastructure for provider validation

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing Azure deployments
- Provider abstractions must not introduce significant performance overhead
