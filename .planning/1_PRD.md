# Azure Blob Storage Integration - Product Requirements Document

**Date**: September 11, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

### Feature Summary
Integrate Azure Blob Storage for secure, scalable document storage in the BetterCallSaul legal case management system, replacing the current insecure local file storage implementation.

### Problem Statement
The current file upload system stores legal documents in a web-accessible local directory (`/uploads/temp/`), creating security vulnerabilities and lacking scalability for production deployment.

### Goals
1. **Security**: Store legal documents securely with proper access controls
2. **Scalability**: Support large volumes of legal document storage
3. **Reliability**: Ensure 99.9% availability for document access
4. **Cost-effectiveness**: Implement pay-per-use storage model
5. **Compliance**: Meet legal industry data retention requirements

### Success Metrics
- 100% of new document uploads stored in Azure Blob Storage
- Zero security incidents related to document storage
- <100ms average file upload/download latency
- 99.9% storage availability SLA
- <$0.05/GB monthly storage cost

## Requirements

### Core Functional Requirements
1. **File Upload**: Store uploaded legal documents in Azure Blob Storage
2. **File Download**: Retrieve documents securely with proper authentication
3. **File Management**: Delete documents and manage storage lifecycle
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper SAS token-based access
5. **Fallback Support**: Maintain local storage for development environments

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints
- Maximum file size: 50MB per document
- Support for PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT file formats
- 500MB/hour upload limit per user

### Dependencies
- Azure Storage Account with Blob Storage enabled
- Azure.Storage.Blobs NuGet package
- Existing file validation and virus scanning services

## User Experience

### User Flow
1. User uploads legal document via web interface
2. File validated (type, size, virus scan)
3. Document stored in Azure Blob Storage with unique blob name
4. Metadata stored in SQL database with blob reference
5. User can view/download document via secure SAS URLs

### UI Considerations
- No frontend changes required initially
- Future: Progress indicators for large file uploads
- Future: Storage usage dashboard for administrators

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- ✅ Files uploaded to Azure Blob Storage instead of local directory
- ✅ Secure SAS token generation for file access
- ✅ Database records contain proper blob storage references
- ✅ Fallback to local storage when Azure configuration missing
- ✅ All existing file upload API endpoints remain functional
- ✅ File deletion properly removes blobs from Azure storage

### Nice to Have
- Progress tracking for large file uploads
- Storage analytics and usage reporting
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned blobs
- Content delivery network (CDN) integration

## Open Questions

⚠️ **Critical Unknowns**:
- Production Azure Storage Account connection details
- SAS token expiration policy requirements
- Data retention and archival policies
- Disaster recovery requirements for stored documents

**Assumptions**:
- Azure Storage Account will be provisioned separately
- SAS tokens with 1-hour expiration are sufficient for initial implementation
- Local storage fallback is acceptable for development environments

**Next Steps**:
1. Review architecture decisions for technical implementation approach
2. Create detailed implementation breakdown with task dependencies
3. Identify and mitigate key risks in the implementation plan
