## Critical Test Scenarios

### Document Processing
- [ ] PDF document upload and extraction
- [ ] DOCX document processing
- [ ] Large file handling (>100MB)
- [ ] Malicious file detection
- [ ] Extraction accuracy validation

### Generative AI Analysis
- [ ] Case viability scoring accuracy with reasoning
- [ ] Plea deal recommendation logic with explanations
- [ ] Risk factor identification and narrative analysis
- [ ] Analysis consistency and hallucination detection
- [ ] Performance under various document types and lengths

### Legal Research Integration
- [ ] API search functionality
- [ ] Result parsing and display
- [ ] Error handling for API failures
- [ ] Rate limiting compliance
- [ ] Search relevance validation

### User Workflows
- [ ] End-to-end case management
- [ ] Document review and annotation
- [ ] Analysis result interpretation
- [ ] Decision tracking and outcomes
- [ ] Multi-user collaboration

## Edge Cases

### Data-Related
- Empty or corrupted documents
- Extremely large case files
- Unsupported file formats
- Special characters in legal text
- Cross-jurisdiction legal references

### System-Related
- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limiting scenarios
- Database connection failures
- High concurrent user load
- Storage capacity limits

### User-Related
- Simultaneous document edits
- Permission boundary testing
- Session timeout handling
- Browser compatibility issues
- Accessibility requirements

## Testing Environment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local database with test data
- Mock external APIs
- Automated test execution
- Code coverage reporting

### Staging Environment
- Production-like infrastructure
- Real external API integrations
- Performance testing suite
- User acceptance testing

### Production Testing
- Canary deployments
- A/B testing for new features
- Real-user monitoring
- Gradual feature rollouts

## Automated vs Manual Testing

### Automated (80% target)
- Unit and integration tests
- API contract testing
- UI component testing
- Performance regression tests
- Security scanning

### Manual (20% target)
- User experience validation
- Complex legal scenario testing
- Exploratory testing
- Accessibility compliance
- Real-world workflow testing

## Testing Tools & Frameworks

### .NET Testing
- **xUnit**: Primary test framework
- **Moq/NSubstitute**: Mocking frameworks
- **TestServer**: Integration testing
- **Coverlet**: Code coverage

### UI Testing  
- **bUnit**: Blazor component testing
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing
- **Selenium**: Browser automation (fallback)

### Performance & Load
- **k6**: Load testing
- **Azure Load Testing**: Cloud-scale testing
- **Application Insights**: Performance monitoring

### Security
- **OWASP ZAP**: Security scanning
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security
- **Azure Security Center**: Cloud security

## Test Data Strategy

### Synthetic Data
- Generated legal documents
- Mock case data
- Anonymized real-world patterns

### Production-like Data
- Sanitized real case data (with permissions)
- Real legal database responses
- Actual document formats and structures

### Data Management
- Version-controlled test data
- Data refresh procedures
- Privacy-compliant data handling

## Next Steps
1. Set up test infrastructure and tooling
2. Develop test data generation strategies
3. Create detailed test case specifications
4. Establish test automation pipeline
5. Define quality gates and metrics
