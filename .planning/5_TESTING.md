**Created:** 2025-09-14
**Version:** 1.0

## Testing Overview

### Testing Objectives
1. **Functional Validation**: Ensure all features work with simplified service architecture
2. **Integration Verification**: Validate service interactions in both development and production environments
3. **Performance Validation**: Confirm no significant performance degradation
4. **Configuration Testing**: Verify environment-based service selection works correctly
5. **Regression Prevention**: Ensure existing functionality remains intact

### Testing Scope

**In Scope:**
- All API endpoints and business logic
- Service implementation switching (dev vs prod)
- File upload, storage, and retrieval operations
- AI analysis and text extraction functionality
- Configuration management and environment detection
- Database operations and data integrity

**Out of Scope:**
- Azure service functionality (being removed)
- User interface testing (no frontend changes expected)
- Performance optimization beyond baseline validation
- New feature development
