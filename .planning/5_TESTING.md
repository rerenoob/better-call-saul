**Version:** 1.0

## MVP Test Categories

### 1. Unit Testing
**Scope**: Core business logic and services  
**Tools**: xUnit (built-in with .NET 8)  
**Coverage Target**: 60%+ for MVP business logic

**Key Areas**:
- Document text extraction services
- AI client service for Azure OpenAI
- Authentication logic
- Case management operations
- File validation and processing

### 2. Integration Testing
**Scope**: Database and external service integration  
**Tools**: TestServer, HttpClient, SQL Server LocalDB  
**Coverage Target**: Core workflow coverage

**Key Areas**:
- Entity Framework Core with LocalDB
- Azure OpenAI API integration
- Authentication flow end-to-end
- Document upload and storage
- Case creation and document association

### 3. UI/Component Testing
**Scope**: Basic Blazor component functionality  
**Tools**: bUnit for critical components  
**Coverage Target**: Key user interactions

**Key Areas**:
- Document upload component
- Case list and detail pages
- AI analysis results display
- Login/logout functionality

### 4. Manual Testing
**Scope**: Complete user workflows (manual for MVP)  
**Tools**: Manual testing with test scenarios  
**Coverage Target**: Core user journey

**Key Scenarios**:
- User registration and login
- Case creation and document upload
- AI analysis execution and results review
- Document text extraction validation
- Error handling (invalid files, API failures)

### 5. Basic Performance Testing
**Scope**: Single-user performance validation  
**Tools**: Manual timing and basic monitoring  
**Coverage Target**: Acceptable response times

**Key Metrics**:
- Document upload and processing time (<30 seconds)
- AI analysis response time (<60 seconds)
- Page load times (<3 seconds)
- File size limits and handling

### 6. Basic Security Testing
**Scope**: Essential security for MVP  
**Tools**: Manual security testing, basic validation  
**Coverage Target**: Critical security areas

**Key Areas**:
- Authentication bypass attempts
- File upload validation (malicious files)
- Basic authorization (user can only see their cases)
- API key protection
- Sample data only (no production data)

## MVP Critical Test Scenarios

### Document Processing
- [ ] PDF document upload and text extraction
- [ ] DOCX document processing
- [ ] File size limits (max 10MB for MVP)
- [ ] Invalid file type rejection
- [ ] Basic text extraction accuracy

### AI Analysis
- [ ] Document summary generation
- [ ] Basic recommendation output (proceed/review)
- [ ] API error handling when service unavailable
- [ ] Response time within acceptable limits
- [ ] AI response quality with sample legal documents

### Case Management
- [ ] Create new case with basic information
- [ ] Associate documents with cases
- [ ] View case list and details
- [ ] Edit case information
- [ ] Delete cases (with confirmation)

### User Workflows
- [ ] Complete workflow: register → login → create case → upload document → get AI analysis
- [ ] User can navigate between all major features
- [ ] Proper logout and session handling
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and clear

## Edge Cases

### Data-Related
- Empty or corrupted documents
- Extremely large case files
- Unsupported file formats
- Special characters in legal text
- Cross-jurisdiction legal references

### System-Related
- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limiting scenarios
- Database connection failures
- High concurrent user load
- Storage capacity limits

### User-Related
- Simultaneous document edits
- Permission boundary testing
- Session timeout handling
- Browser compatibility issues
- Accessibility requirements

## MVP Testing Environment Strategy

### Development Environment
- SQL Server LocalDB with sample data
- Real Azure OpenAI API (with budget limits)
- Manual test execution
- Basic test result tracking

### Demo Environment
- Same as development but with clean sample data
- Prepared demo scenarios and test cases
- User testing sessions with public defenders
- Feedback collection and tracking

## MVP Automated vs Manual Testing

### Automated (40% target)
- Unit tests for core business logic
- Basic integration tests
- Simple API testing

### Manual (60% target)
- User workflow testing
- AI response quality validation
- Error handling scenarios
- Cross-browser compatibility
- User experience validation

## Testing Tools & Frameworks

### .NET Testing
- **xUnit**: Primary test framework
- **Moq/NSubstitute**: Mocking frameworks
- **TestServer**: Integration testing
- **Coverlet**: Code coverage

### UI Testing  
- **bUnit**: Blazor component testing
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing
- **Selenium**: Browser automation (fallback)

### Performance & Load
- **k6**: Load testing
- **Azure Load Testing**: Cloud-scale testing
- **Application Insights**: Performance monitoring

### Security
- **OWASP ZAP**: Security scanning
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security
- **Azure Security Center**: Cloud security

## MVP Test Data Strategy

### Sample Data Only
- Created sample legal documents (PDFs and DOCX)
- Mock case scenarios for different document types
- No real legal data or sensitive information

### Data Sources
- Public domain legal documents
- Created fictional case scenarios
- Simple test documents for edge cases

### Data Management
- Test documents stored in repository
- Clear labeling as sample/test data only
- Easy to reproduce test scenarios

## Next Steps
1. **Week 1**: Set up basic xUnit test project
2. **Week 2**: Create sample legal documents for testing
3. **Week 3-4**: Write unit tests as features are developed
4. **Week 5**: Conduct user testing sessions
5. **Week 6**: Manual testing of complete workflows
6. **Post-MVP**: Plan comprehensive testing strategy for Phase 2
