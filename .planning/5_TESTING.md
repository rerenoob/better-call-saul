# Testing Strategy - Better Call Saul

**Created:** September 4, 2025  
**Version:** 1.1 - Updated for React Frontend Architecture

## Testing Overview

### Testing Philosophy
Our testing approach prioritizes **legal accuracy**, **security compliance**, and **user confidence** while ensuring system reliability and performance. Given the critical nature of legal decision support, we employ comprehensive validation at all levels.

### Quality Gates
- **85% minimum unit test coverage** for business-critical components
- **Zero critical security vulnerabilities** before production release
- **<5 minute response time** for AI analysis under normal load
- **99.5% uptime** during business hours (8 AM - 8 PM local time)
- **User acceptance score >4.0/5.0** from legal professionals

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task AnalyzeCase_ValidDocument_ReturnsAccuratePrediction()
{
    // Arrange: Mock document with known outcome data
    // Act: Process through AI analysis
    // Assert: Prediction accuracy within acceptable thresholds
}

[Theory]
[InlineData("criminal-defense-case.pdf", CaseType.Criminal)]
[InlineData("civil-rights-case.pdf", CaseType.CivilRights)]
public async Task ExtractCaseType_ValidDocuments_CorrectlyIdentifiesType(string filename, CaseType expected)
{
    // Test case type identification across different legal document formats
}
```

### 2. Integration Testing

#### API Integration Testing
**Focus Areas:**
- Azure OpenAI Service integration with realistic prompts and responses
- Legal database API calls with rate limiting and error handling
- File upload and processing pipeline end-to-end validation

**Critical Integration Points:**
```csharp
[Test]
public async Task ProcessCaseDocument_EndToEnd_CompletesSuccessfully()
{
    // 1. Upload document through secure endpoint
