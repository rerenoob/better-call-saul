## Architecture Summary

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 Web API
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based authorization
- **Database**: Entity Framework Core + SQL Server
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent response formats
- **Security**: Double authorization checks (frontend + backend)

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first design
- **State Management**: React hooks + React Query
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with nested routes
- **API Client**: Axios with interceptors

### Key Design Patterns
1. **Repository Pattern**: EF Core with optimized queries
2. **Service Layer**: Centralized business logic
3. **Component Composition**: Reusable React components
4. **Custom Hooks**: Abstracted state management
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

## Security Implementation

### ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures
- Role-based access control (`[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`)
- JWT token validation
- Frontend route protection (`ProtectedRoute requireAdmin`)
- Audit logging of all admin actions
- Input validation and parameterized queries
- HTTPS enforcement

### üîÑ Needed Enhancements
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Rate limiting on admin endpoints
- Enhanced audit log details
- Security headers configuration
- Regular security scanning

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Performance
- **API Response Times**: < 500ms for most endpoints
- **Database Queries**: Optimized with EF Core projections
- **Frontend Loading**: Efficient component rendering
- **Pagination**: Implemented for large datasets

### Areas for Optimization
- **Database Indexing**: Additional indexes for admin queries
- **Query Optimization**: Further EF Core query tuning
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement response caching
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting for admin routes

## Testing Coverage

### ‚úÖ Current Test Implementation
- **Backend Unit Tests**: Basic controller tests
- **Frontend Unit Tests**: Component and hook tests
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing

### üîÑ Testing Gaps
- **Comprehensive E2E Tests**: Playwright/Cypress tests needed
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Security Tests**: Penetration testing
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance verification

## Deployment Status

### Current Deployment
- **Backend**: .NET 8 Web API deployable to Azure App Service
- **Frontend**: React app buildable with Vite
- **Database**: SQL Server with EF Core migrations

### Deployment Considerations
- **Environment Configuration**: Separate settings for admin features
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights integration
- **Scaling**: Read replicas for admin reporting queries
- **Backups**: Regular database backups with log retention

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Technical Limitations
1. **User Activity Feed**: Currently uses mock data, needs real API
2. **Analysis Time Metric**: Placeholder implementation, requires Case model changes
3. **Mobile Experience**: Basic responsiveness, needs optimization
4. **Export Functionality**: Not yet implemented
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Limited to basic pagination

### Performance Considerations
1. **Large Datasets**: Pagination implemented but may need optimization for very large datasets
2. **Real-time Updates**: 30-second intervals may need adjustment based on load
3. **Database Load**: Admin queries should be monitored for production impact
