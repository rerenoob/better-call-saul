**Version:** 1.0

## Top Risks

### Risk 1: Legal Database API Access & Integration (DEFERRED TO PHASE 2)
**Impact Level:** Medium (was Critical)  
**Probability:** Medium (was High)  
**Description:** Unable to secure API access to legal databases for Phase 2 expansion.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **MVP Approach**: Remove dependency on external legal databases for initial version
- **Research Phase**: Investigate Westlaw, LexisNexis, and free alternatives like Justia
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks before Phase 2 development begins
- **Owner**: Technical Lead + Legal Domain Expert
- **Contingency**: Focus on document analysis and basic AI recommendations without external research

### Risk 2: AI Analysis Accuracy for Legal Content
**Impact Level:** High  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Description:** AI may produce inaccurate or inappropriate legal analysis due to lack of legal domain specialization.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Immediate**: Start with basic document summarization and simple recommendations
- **Week 1-2**: Develop and test legal-specific prompts with sample documents
- **Week 3-4**: Implement confidence scoring and uncertainty indicators
- **Owner**: AI Specialist + Legal Domain Expert
- **Validation**: All AI outputs flagged as "AI-generated, requires review"
- **Contingency**: Limit AI to document extraction and basic summaries only

### Risk 3: Data Security & Privacy (SIMPLIFIED FOR MVP)
**Impact Level:** Medium (was Critical)  
**Probability:** Low (was High)  
**Description:** Basic security vulnerabilities in MVP could expose sensitive documents.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Immediate**: Use sample/anonymized documents for all MVP testing
- **Week 1**: Implement basic file upload validation and secure storage
- **Week 2**: Add basic authentication and session management
- **Owner**: Lead Developer
- **MVP Limitation**: No production legal documents until Phase 2 security review
- **Phase 2 Planning**: Full regulatory compliance assessment scheduled for Week 8-10

### Risk 4: User Adoption & Usability
**Impact Level:** High  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Description:** Target users may find MVP interface confusing or not valuable enough to continue using.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Week 2-3**: Conduct user interviews with 3-5 public defenders
- **Week 4-5**: User testing sessions with paper prototypes
- **Week 6-7**: MVP user testing with real feedback incorporation
- **Owner**: UX Lead + Legal Domain Expert
- **Success Metrics**: 70%+ users can complete core workflow without assistance
- **Contingency**: Pivot to different user interface approach based on feedback

### Risk 5: Azure OpenAI API Costs & Rate Limits
**Impact Level:** Medium  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Description:** Unexpected API costs or rate limiting could impact MVP testing and demonstration.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Week 1**: Set up Azure billing alerts and usage monitoring
- **Ongoing**: Implement request caching and optimize prompt efficiency
- **Budget**: Allocate $200/month for MVP testing phase
- **Owner**: Technical Lead
- **Monitoring**: Weekly cost review and usage analysis
- **Contingency**: Switch to smaller/cheaper models or reduce analysis frequency

## Risk Categorization

### Showstoppers (Require Immediate Attention)
1. **Legal Database Access**: Without legal data, core value proposition fails
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Cannot deploy without meeting legal standards

### Manageable Risks (Require Planning)
3. **Generative AI Accuracy**: Can start with augmented reasoning and improve iteratively
4. **User Adoption**: Addressable through UX design and training
5. **Performance**: Solvable through architecture and optimization

## Risk Monitoring

### Key Indicators to Watch
- **API Integration Progress**: Weekly status on legal database access
- **AI Performance**: Regular accuracy testing and hallucination detection
- **Compliance Checklist**: Ongoing verification against regulatory requirements
- **User Feedback**: Early and continuous user testing feedback

### Early Warning Signs
- Delays in securing API partnerships
- AI accuracy below 70% or high hallucination rates
- Compliance requirements exceeding current capabilities
- User resistance during early testing

## Mitigation Timeline

### Week 1-2 (Setup Phase)
- Set up Azure OpenAI API with billing alerts
- Implement basic file upload validation
- Begin user research interviews
- Create sample legal documents for testing

### Week 3-4 (Development Phase)
- Test and refine legal AI prompts
- Implement basic authentication system
- Conduct user testing sessions
- Monitor API usage and costs

### Week 5-6 (Validation Phase)
- User testing with MVP prototype
- AI accuracy testing with sample documents
- Security review of local deployment
- Plan Phase 2 risk assessment

### Week 7-8 (Refinement Phase)
- Incorporate user feedback
- Optimize AI prompt performance
- Document lessons learned for Phase 2
- Begin Phase 2 planning with updated risk profile

## Next Steps
1. **Week 1**: Assign specific owners to each risk (Technical Lead, UX Lead, AI Specialist)
2. **Week 2**: Set up weekly risk review meetings with team
3. **Ongoing**: Update risk assessment based on MVP development learnings
4. **Week 6**: Conduct mid-MVP risk review and adjust Phase 2 planning
5. **Week 8**: Complete comprehensive risk assessment for Phase 2 planning
