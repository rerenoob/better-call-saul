*Created: 2025-09-14*

## Risk 1: Provider Feature Parity and Quality Differences

### Impact Level: **HIGH** 游댮
### Probability: **MEDIUM** 游리

### Description
Different cloud providers offer varying capabilities, quality levels, and response formats for AI, storage, and document processing services. This could lead to inconsistent user experiences or degraded functionality when switching providers.

### Specific Concerns
- **AI Model Variations**: Azure OpenAI GPT-4 vs AWS Claude vs Google Gemini have different strengths, response styles, and context limits
- **Document Processing Accuracy**: Azure Form Recognizer vs AWS Textract vs Google Document AI may have different accuracy levels for legal documents
- **Response Time Differences**: Network latency and processing speeds vary between providers and regions
- **Feature Availability**: Some providers may lack specific features (e.g., streaming responses, certain file formats)

### Potential Impact
- User complaints about inconsistent analysis quality
- Legal professionals losing confidence in system reliability
- Reduced adoption of cloud-agnostic deployment options
- Need for extensive provider-specific tuning and optimization

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Benchmarking**
   - Create standardized test cases for each service type
   - Measure accuracy, response time, and feature coverage for all providers
   - Document performance baselines and acceptable variance ranges

2. **Quality Normalization Layer**

## Risk 2: Complex Configuration Management and Operational Overhead

### Impact Level: **MEDIUM** 游리
### Probability: **HIGH** 游댮

### Description
Managing configurations, credentials, and operational procedures across multiple cloud providers significantly increases system complexity and the potential for configuration errors.

### Specific Concerns

- **Credential Management**: Secure handling of multiple sets of API keys, service accounts, and access tokens
- **Deployment Complexity**: CI/CD pipelines must support multiple target platforms with different requirements
- **Monitoring Fragmentation**: Different providers require different monitoring and alerting approaches

### Potential Impact
- Production outages due to misconfiguration
- Security vulnerabilities from improper credential management
- Increased operational costs and team training requirements
- Deployment delays and troubleshooting difficulties

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Create provider-specific CloudFormation/Terraform templates
   - Implement configuration validation in CI/CD pipelines
   - Use version control for all configuration changes

2. **Centralized Secret Management**
   - Integrate with each provider's secret management service (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager)
   - Implement secret rotation policies and automated key management
   - Create secure development workflows for local testing

3. **Unified Monitoring and Observability**
   - Implement application-level monitoring that works across all providers
   - Create standardized dashboards and alerting rules
   - Use distributed tracing to track requests across provider boundaries

4. **Operational Runbooks**
   - Document provider-specific troubleshooting procedures
   - Create automated health checks and self-healing capabilities
   - Establish escalation procedures for provider-specific issues

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Configuration errors caught in CI/CD pipeline before deployment
- [ ] Mean time to resolution (MTTR) for provider issues under 30 minutes
- [ ] Zero security incidents related to credential management

## Risk 3: Vendor Lock-in Through Provider-Specific Optimizations

### Impact Level: **MEDIUM** 游리
### Probability: **MEDIUM** 游리

### Description
As teams optimize performance and capabilities for specific providers, the codebase may gradually become re-coupled to particular vendors, defeating the purpose of the cloud-agnostic architecture.

### Specific Concerns
- **Performance Optimizations**: Provider-specific code paths that improve performance but reduce portability
- **Feature Utilization**: Using advanced provider-specific features that don't have equivalents elsewhere
- **Development Practices**: Teams may default to testing and optimizing for a single "preferred" provider
- **Technical Debt**: Over time, provider-specific workarounds and customizations accumulate

### Potential Impact
- Gradual erosion of cloud agnosticism over time
- Difficulty switching providers despite architectural investments
- Increased maintenance burden for multiple code paths
- Reduced ability to negotiate with vendors due to effective lock-in

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Architectural Governance**
   - Establish coding standards that prevent provider-specific logic in business layers
   - Implement automated checks for provider abstraction violations
   - Create architectural decision record (ADR) process for provider-specific features

2. **Regular Portability Audits**
   - Quarterly reviews of provider abstraction adherence
   - Automated testing that validates functionality across all supported providers
   - Performance benchmarking to ensure no provider becomes overly dominant

3. **Feature Parity Enforcement**
   - Maintain feature compatibility matrices across providers
   - Reject features that can't be reasonably implemented across all supported providers
   - Create provider-agnostic testing requirements for new features

4. **Team Education and Process**
   - Train development teams on cloud-agnostic principles
   - Implement peer review processes that check for provider coupling
   - Create incentives for maintaining provider neutrality

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All business logic remains provider-agnostic in quarterly audits
- [ ] New features work identically across all supported providers
- [ ] Provider switching takes less than 4 hours for any environment

## Risk 4: Performance and Cost Optimization Challenges

### Impact Level: **MEDIUM** 游리
### Probability: **HIGH** 游댮

### Description
Cloud-agnostic architectures may introduce performance overhead and complicate cost optimization strategies, potentially making the solution less efficient than provider-optimized alternatives.

### Specific Concerns
- **Abstraction Overhead**: Additional layers between application and cloud services may impact response times
- **Cost Visibility**: Difficult to compare costs across providers due to different pricing models
- **Resource Utilization**: Generic configurations may not leverage provider-specific optimization features
- **Geographic Distribution**: Optimal provider selection may vary by region and use case

### Potential Impact
- Higher operational costs compared to single-provider solutions
- Performance degradation affecting user experience
- Difficulty justifying cloud-agnostic approach based on cost/performance metrics
- Suboptimal resource utilization across different providers

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Performance Monitoring and Optimization**
