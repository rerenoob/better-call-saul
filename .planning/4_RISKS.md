**Version:** 1.0

## Top Risks

### Risk 1: Legal Database API Access & Integration
**Impact Level:** Critical  
**Probability:** High  
**Description:** Unable to secure API access to legal databases or facing complex integration challenges that delay core functionality.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Immediate**: Identify alternative legal data sources and fallback options
- **Short-term**: Develop mock API services for development while pursuing access
- **Long-term**: Establish partnerships with multiple legal database providers
- **Contingency**: Implement manual research workflow as fallback

### Risk 2: Generative AI Accuracy & Hallucination
**Impact Level:** High  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Description:** Generative AI models may produce inaccurate legal analysis, hallucinations, or inconsistent reasoning that could lead to poor legal advice.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Immediate**: Start with rule-based analysis augmented by LLM reasoning
- **Short-term**: Implement rigorous prompt engineering and validation layers
- **Long-term**: Fine-tune models on legal domain data with human feedback
- **Contingency**: Use human-in-the-loop validation for all critical legal recommendations

### Risk 3: Regulatory Compliance & Data Privacy
**Impact Level:** Critical  
**Probability:** High  
**Description:** Failure to meet legal industry regulations for data handling, privacy, and security could prevent deployment.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Immediate**: Engage legal counsel early for compliance requirements
- **Short-term**: Implement strict data encryption and access controls
- **Long-term**: Pursue industry certifications (SOC 2, HIPAA if applicable)
- **Contingency**: Design for data residency and jurisdiction-specific compliance

### Risk 4: User Adoption & Workflow Integration
**Impact Level:** High  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Description:** Public defenders may resist adopting new technology or struggle to integrate it into existing workflows.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Immediate**: Conduct user research with target audience early
- **Short-term**: Design for incremental adoption and minimal workflow disruption
- **Long-term**: Provide comprehensive training and support resources
- **Contingency**: Offer phased rollout with super-user support

### Risk 5: Performance at Scale
**Impact Level:** Medium  
**Probability:** Low  
**Description:** System may not perform adequately under high load with large document processing and AI analysis demands.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Immediate**: Design for scalability from architecture outset
- **Short-term**: Implement performance monitoring and load testing early
- **Long-term**: Use cloud auto-scaling and optimized processing pipelines
- **Contingency**: Implement queuing and batch processing for resource-intensive operations

## Risk Categorization

### Showstoppers (Require Immediate Attention)
1. **Legal Database Access**: Without legal data, core value proposition fails
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Cannot deploy without meeting legal standards

### Manageable Risks (Require Planning)
3. **Generative AI Accuracy**: Can start with augmented reasoning and improve iteratively
4. **User Adoption**: Addressable through UX design and training
5. **Performance**: Solvable through architecture and optimization

## Risk Monitoring

### Key Indicators to Watch
- **API Integration Progress**: Weekly status on legal database access
- **AI Performance**: Regular accuracy testing and hallucination detection
- **Compliance Checklist**: Ongoing verification against regulatory requirements
- **User Feedback**: Early and continuous user testing feedback

### Early Warning Signs
- Delays in securing API partnerships
- AI accuracy below 70% or high hallucination rates
- Compliance requirements exceeding current capabilities
- User resistance during early testing

## Mitigation Timeline

### Immediate (Next 2 weeks)
- Identify alternative data sources
- Begin compliance requirement gathering
- Start user research sessions

### Short-term (Next month)
- Establish API integration proof of concepts
- Develop rule-based analysis with LLM augmentation
- Implement core security controls

### Ongoing
- Continuous AI performance improvement and fine-tuning
- Regular compliance audits
- User feedback incorporation

## Next Steps
1. Assign risk owners for each critical risk
2. Develop detailed mitigation action plans
3. Establish regular risk review meetings
4. Create risk tracking dashboard
