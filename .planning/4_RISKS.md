# Azure Blob Storage Integration - Risk Assessment

**Date**: September 11, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Draft

## Top Risks

### Risk 1: Azure Storage Connectivity Issues
**Impact Level**: High  
**Probability**: Medium  

**Description**:  
Azure Storage outages or connectivity problems could prevent file uploads/downloads, disrupting legal case management workflows.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement robust retry policies with exponential backoff
- Use fallback to local storage when Azure is unavailable
- Monitor Azure status and implement circuit breaker pattern
- Set up Azure Service Health alerts for proactive notification

### Risk 2: SAS Token Security Vulnerabilities
**Impact Level**: High  
**Probability**: Low  

**Description**:  
Improper SAS token implementation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive legal documents.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement strict token expiration policies (1-hour default)
- Validate user permissions before generating tokens
- Use minimal required permissions (read-only for downloads)
- Regular security reviews and penetration testing
- Monitor token usage patterns for anomalies

### Risk 3: Data Migration Challenges
**Impact Level**: Medium  
**Probability**: Medium  

**Description**:  
Migration of existing local files to Azure Blob Storage could fail or corrupt data, leading to document loss.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement incremental migration with verification steps
- Maintain backup of original files during migration
- Create comprehensive migration logging and rollback procedures
- Test migration thoroughly with sample data before production
- Validate checksums after migration completion

### Risk 4: Cost Overruns
**Impact Level**: Medium  
**Probability**: Low  

**Description**:  
Unexpected Azure Storage costs due to incorrect configuration or usage patterns.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement storage usage monitoring and alerts
- Use appropriate storage tiers (hot/cool/archive)
- Set up Azure Cost Management budgets and alerts
- Regular review of storage patterns and optimization
- Implement automatic cleanup of temporary files

### Risk 5: Performance Degradation
**Impact Level**: Medium  
**Probability**: Low  

**Description**:  
Latency introduced by cloud storage could impact user experience for document access.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed documents
- Use Azure CDN for global content delivery
- Monitor and optimize blob storage performance
- Implement progressive loading for large documents
- Set performance baselines and alert on deviations

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Severity | Mitigation Status |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Azure Connectivity | High | Medium | High | Planned |
| SAS Token Security | High | Low | Medium | Planned |
| Data Migration | Medium | Medium | Medium | Planned |
| Cost Overruns | Medium | Low | Low | Planned |
| Performance Issues | Medium | Low | Low | Planned |

## Showstoppers vs Manageable Risks

### Showstoppers (Must Resolve Before Launch)
- **Azure Connectivity**: Complete fallback implementation required
- **SAS Token Security**: Comprehensive security review mandatory

### Manageable Risks (Can Address Post-Launch)
- **Data Migration**: Can be performed gradually after core launch
- **Cost Optimization**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment
- **Performance Tuning**: Iterative improvements based on usage

## Contingency Plans

### If Azure Storage Fails:
1. Automatically switch to local storage fallback
2. Notify administrators of storage outage
3. Queue uploads for retry when Azure recovers
4. Provide read-only access to locally cached documents

### If Migration Fails:
1. Halt migration process immediately
2. Restore from backups if necessary
3. Analyze failure cause and update migration strategy
4. Resume migration with improved procedures

### If Costs Exceed Budget:
1. Immediately review and optimize storage configuration
2. Implement more aggressive cleanup policies
3. Consider moving older documents to cooler storage tiers
4. Adjust user upload limits if necessary

**Next Steps**:
1. Develop comprehensive testing strategy to validate risk mitigations
2. Create implementation checklist with risk mitigation verification
3. Establish monitoring and alerting for key risk indicators
