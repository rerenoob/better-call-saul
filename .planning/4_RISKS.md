**Created:** 2025-09-14
**Version:** 1.0

## High-Impact Risks

### Risk 1: Breaking API Contracts During Service Removal
**Impact:** High | **Probability:** Medium | **Category:** Technical

**Description:**
Removing Azure service implementations and interfaces may inadvertently break existing API contracts, causing frontend integration failures or API endpoint errors.

**Potential Consequences:**
- Frontend application stops working with backend
- API endpoints return unexpected responses or errors
- User-facing functionality becomes unavailable
- Production deployment failures

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Preserve all existing interfaces**: Keep `IAIService`, `IStorageService`, `ITextExtractionService` unchanged
- **Maintain response models**: Ensure all API response models remain identical
- **API contract testing**: Run comprehensive API tests before and after changes
- **Staged deployment**: Use staging environment to validate API compatibility
- **Rollback plan**: Maintain ability to quickly revert changes if issues arise

**Monitoring:**
- Monitor API response schemas during testing
- Run integration tests continuously during development
- Validate all controller endpoints return expected data structures

### Risk 2: Data Inaccessibility After Azure Storage Removal
**Impact:** High | **Probability:** Low | **Category:** Data

**Description:**
Existing files stored in Azure Blob Storage may become inaccessible after removing Azure storage service implementation, leading to data loss or broken file references.

**Potential Consequences:**
- Previously uploaded documents become inaccessible
- File URLs in database point to non-functional storage
- Historical case data missing critical document evidence
- User complaints about missing files

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Data audit**: Identify if any production data exists in Azure Blob Storage
- **Migration planning**: Create file migration scripts if needed
- **Fallback service**: Maintain read-only Azure access during transition period
- **Documentation**: Clear communication about data migration requirements
- **Testing**: Validate file access with existing file references

**Monitoring:**
- Check production environment for existing Azure Blob Storage usage
- Test file download functionality with existing file IDs
- Monitor error logs for Azure storage access attempts

### Risk 3: Production Environment Configuration Errors
**Impact:** High | **Probability:** Medium | **Category:** Deployment

**Description:**
Simplified configuration structure may lead to deployment issues if production environment variables or configuration files are not properly updated to match the new architecture.

**Potential Consequences:**
- Production deployment failures
- Service startup errors due to missing configuration
- Fallback to mock services in production environment
- Degraded user experience with non-functional features

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Configuration validation**: Create startup validation for required AWS configuration
- **Environment documentation**: Clear deployment guide with required environment variables
- **Staging testing**: Thorough testing in production-like staging environment
- **Configuration templates**: Provide clear configuration examples for production
- **Gradual rollout**: Deploy to staging first, then production with monitoring

**Monitoring:**
- Application startup logging for configuration validation
- Health check endpoints to validate service functionality
- Error monitoring for configuration-related failures

## Medium-Impact Risks

### Risk 4: Performance Degradation in Development Environment
**Impact:** Medium | **Probability:** Medium | **Category:** Performance

**Description:**
Mock services may not accurately simulate production performance characteristics, leading to development-production performance discrepancies or unrealistic development expectations.

**Potential Consequences:**
- Development environment not representative of production
- Performance issues discovered late in development cycle
- User expectations set incorrectly during development
- Inadequate performance testing during development

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Realistic delays**: Mock services should simulate realistic processing times
- **Performance benchmarking**: Regular performance testing against production environment
- **Load testing**: Include mock services in load testing scenarios
- **Development guidelines**: Clear documentation about development vs production performance
- **Monitoring integration**: Include performance metrics in development environment

**Monitoring:**
- Response time metrics for mock vs real services
- Performance regression testing during development
- Regular comparison of development and production metrics

### Risk 5: Incomplete Test Coverage After Architecture Changes
**Impact:** Medium | **Probability:** Medium | **Category:** Quality

**Description:**
Removing Azure services and updating service registration may leave gaps in test coverage, particularly around edge cases and error scenarios that were previously tested with Azure-specific implementations.

**Potential Consequences:**
- Undetected bugs in production deployment
- Regression in functionality that was previously tested
- Insufficient coverage of error handling scenarios
- Quality degradation in released features

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Test audit**: Review all existing tests for coverage gaps after Azure removal
- **Mock service testing**: Comprehensive testing of mock service implementations
- **Integration test updates**: Ensure integration tests cover new service patterns
- **Error scenario testing**: Validate error handling with new service implementations
- **Code coverage monitoring**: Maintain or improve code coverage percentages

**Monitoring:**
- Code coverage reports before and after changes
- Test execution results for all service implementations
- Integration test success rates

### Risk 6: AWS Service Configuration Complexity
**Impact:** Medium | **Probability:** Low | **Category:** Technical

**Description:**
Maintaining AWS services while removing Azure may introduce new configuration complexity or AWS-specific deployment challenges that weren't apparent in the dual-provider setup.

**Potential Consequences:**
- Increased deployment complexity for AWS-only configuration
- AWS service authentication or permission issues
- Unexpected AWS service costs or limits
- Difficulty troubleshooting AWS-specific issues

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **AWS expertise**: Ensure team has adequate AWS configuration knowledge
- **Clear documentation**: Comprehensive AWS setup and troubleshooting guides
- **Testing environments**: Validate AWS configuration in multiple environments
- **Cost monitoring**: Track AWS service usage and costs
- **Support channels**: Establish AWS support processes if needed

**Monitoring:**
- AWS service health and performance metrics
- AWS cost tracking and alerts
- AWS authentication and access logging

## Low-Impact Risks

### Risk 7: Developer Onboarding Complexity
**Impact:** Low | **Probability:** Low | **Category:** Process

**Description:**
New developers may face challenges understanding the simplified architecture or setting up local development environments without cloud dependencies.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Clear documentation**: Comprehensive local development setup guide
- **Automated setup**: Scripts to automate development environment configuration
- **Training materials**: Architecture overview and development patterns
- **Team knowledge sharing**: Internal documentation and training sessions

### Risk 8: Third-Party Integration Impacts
**Impact:** Low | **Probability:** Low | **Category:** Integration

**Description:**
External integrations or monitoring tools that expect Azure services may need updates or may lose functionality.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Integration audit**: Review all external integrations for Azure dependencies
- **Alternative solutions**: Identify replacements for Azure-dependent integrations
- **Communication plan**: Notify relevant stakeholders of architecture changes
