# NoSQL Data Layer Migration - Product Requirements Document

**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Version**: 1.0

## Overview

### Feature Summary
Redesign the Better Call Saul application's data layer to utilize NoSQL databases for legal document storage, case analysis, and AI-generated content while maintaining SQL databases for user management and authentication.

### Problem Statement
The application needs to store new data types that are better suited for NoSQL databases:
- **Large unstructured data**: Case analysis results with complex nested objects, AI responses, document text, and metadata
- **Variable schema content**: Legal documents, AI analysis results, and case research data with different structures
- **JSON storage optimization**: Complex objects (CaseAnalysis, DocumentText, Metadata) are better stored natively in NoSQL rather than JSON strings in SQL

### Goals
1. **Performance**: Improve query performance for document and analysis operations by 60%
2. **Scalability**: Support horizontal scaling for document storage and case analysis data
3. **Schema Flexibility**: Enable dynamic schema evolution for AI analysis results and legal documents
4. **Data Integrity**: Maintain ACID properties for user management while gaining NoSQL benefits for documents
5. **Cost Optimization**: Reduce storage costs for large document datasets by 40%

### Success Metrics
- Query performance improvement: 60% faster document retrieval and analysis queries
- Storage cost optimization: Better cost structure for document data storage
- Development velocity: 25% faster feature development for document-related features
- System reliability: Zero data loss with simplified implementation

## Requirements

### Core Functional Requirements

#### User Management (Keep SQL)
- **R1**: User authentication and authorization must remain in SQL Server with ASP.NET Identity
- **R2**: User profiles, roles, and audit logs must maintain relational integrity
- **R3**: Registration codes and user management workflows must continue using existing SQL patterns

#### Document Storage (Migrate to NoSQL)
- **R4**: Document metadata, file storage references, and processing status move to NoSQL
- **R5**: DocumentText entities with OCR results, confidence scores, and extraction metadata move to NoSQL
- **R6**: Document annotations and user interactions with documents move to NoSQL
- **R7**: Support for flexible metadata schemas without database migrations

#### Case Analysis (Migrate to NoSQL)
- **R8**: CaseAnalysis entities with AI-generated insights, recommendations, and complex nested objects move to NoSQL
- **R9**: Evidence evaluation, timeline analysis, and legal issue identification data move to NoSQL
- **R10**: Support for evolving AI analysis schema as models improve
- **R11**: Efficient querying of analysis results by case, user, and analysis type

#### Legal Research (Migrate to NoSQL)
- **R12**: LegalCase, CourtOpinion, LegalStatute entities move to NoSQL for better text search
- **R13**: Case matching results and similarity scores move to NoSQL
- **R14**: Support for full-text search across legal documents and case law

#### Data Relationships
- **R15**: Maintain referential integrity between SQL user data and NoSQL case/document data
- **R16**: Support cross-database queries and joins through application logic
- **R17**: Implement eventual consistency patterns where appropriate

### Constraints
- **C1**: Zero data loss for new data
- **C2**: No downtime for existing functionality
- **C3**: Maintain existing API contracts and response formats
- **C4**: Support current AWS Bedrock, S3, and Textract integrations
- **C5**: Must work with existing microservices architecture (UserService, CaseService)

### Dependencies
- **D1**: AWS DocumentDB or MongoDB Atlas for document database
- **D2**: Application-level data synchronization patterns
- **D3**: Updated Entity Framework configuration for SQL entities
- **D4**: New NoSQL ODM (Object Document Mapper) implementation

## User Experience

### Basic User Flow
1. **User Login**: Authenticate against SQL Server (unchanged)
2. **Case Creation**: Store case metadata in NoSQL with user reference
3. **Document Upload**: Store document data in NoSQL with case relationship
4. **AI Analysis**: Store complex analysis results in NoSQL with flexible schema
5. **Search & Retrieval**: Query NoSQL for fast document and analysis searches
6. **Audit & Compliance**: Write audit logs to SQL for regulatory compliance

### UI Considerations
- **No UI changes required**: Backend migration should be transparent to frontend
- **Performance improvements**: Faster loading of case analysis and document lists
- **Enhanced search**: Better full-text search capabilities across legal documents

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Criteria
- **AC1**: Document list queries execute in <200ms (currently 800ms)
- **AC2**: Case analysis retrieval executes in <150ms (currently 600ms)
- **AC3**: Full-text search across documents executes in <500ms
- **AC4**: Complex analysis queries (filters, aggregations) execute in <300ms

### Functional Criteria
- **AC5**: All existing API endpoints return identical data structures
- **AC6**: User authentication and authorization work unchanged
- **AC7**: Document upload and processing workflows function identically
- **AC8**: AI analysis and case matching features work without regression
- **AC9**: Audit logging and compliance tracking continue working

### Data Integrity Criteria
- **AC10**: Referential integrity maintained between SQL users and NoSQL cases/documents
- **AC11**: Backup and recovery procedures work for both SQL and NoSQL data
- **AC12**: Data consistency maintained across both databases

### Implementation Criteria
- **AC13**: Direct implementation without complex migration procedures
- **AC14**: Simplified error handling and rollback for new data
- **AC15**: Performance improvements validated through testing
