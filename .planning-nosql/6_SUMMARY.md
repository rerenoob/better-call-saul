# NoSQL Data Layer Migration - Executive Summary

**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Version**: 1.0

## Feature Overview and Value Proposition

The NoSQL Data Layer Migration transforms the Better Call Saul application's data architecture by moving legal document storage, case analysis, and AI-generated content from SQL Server to AWS DocumentDB while maintaining SQL for user management and authentication. This strategic migration addresses current performance bottlenecks, schema rigidity issues, and storage cost inefficiencies that are impacting user experience and system scalability.

**Core Problem**: The application currently stores complex nested objects (case analysis results, document metadata, legal research data) as JSON strings in SQL Server, causing 800ms document query times, expensive storage costs, and maintenance overhead for schema changes.

**Proposed Solution**: Implement a hybrid data architecture using SQL Server for structured user/authentication data and AWS DocumentDB for unstructured legal documents and analysis data, providing native JSON storage, better query performance, and horizontal scalability.

**Business Value**: This migration delivers 60% faster document operations, 40% storage cost reduction, and 25% faster feature development velocity for document-related functionality while maintaining zero data loss and API compatibility.

## Implementation Approach

**Hybrid Data Architecture**: Maintain clear separation between structured relational data (users, roles, audit logs) in SQL Server and unstructured document/analysis data in AWS DocumentDB. This approach preserves ACID properties for critical user management while gaining NoSQL benefits for document operations.

**Migration Strategy**: Implement a dual-write migration pattern over 4 weeks, writing to both databases during transition to ensure zero data loss and enable rapid rollback if issues arise. SQL remains authoritative until final cutover, providing maximum safety.

**Technology Stack**: AWS DocumentDB for MongoDB compatibility, existing AWS infrastructure integration, and familiar development patterns. Use MongoDB .NET driver with repository pattern for consistent data access across the application.

## Timeline Estimate and Key Milestones

**Total Implementation Time**: 15-16 working days (122 hours)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- **Days 1-2**: AWS DocumentDB cluster setup and connectivity
- **Days 3-4**: NoSQL document models and repository implementation

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 2) 
- **Days 5-7**: Service layer updates for hybrid operations
- **Days 8-9**: Data migration scripts and validation
- **Milestone**: Complete data migration capability with validation

### Phase 3: Migration (Week 3)
- **Days 10-11**: Dual-write implementation and testing
- **Days 12-13**: API layer updates and comprehensive testing
- **Milestone**: Dual-write system operational with performance validation

### Phase 4: Cutover (Week 4)
- **Days 14-15**: Production migration execution
- **Day 16**: Final cutover and monitoring
- **Milestone**: NoSQL-primary operations with 60% performance improvement

**Critical Path Dependencies**: Infrastructure → Models → Repositories → Services → Migration → Testing → Production

## Top 3 Risks with Mitigations

### 1. Data Loss During Migration (Critical Risk - 10% probability)
**Impact**: Complete loss of case analysis data could result in legal compliance violations and client trust damage.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Comprehensive backup strategy with multiple restore points
- Dual-write safety net maintaining SQL as authoritative during migration
- Incremental migration in small batches (100 records) with validation
- Automated data consistency checks every hour during migration
- 2-hour rollback capability tested and documented

### 2. Performance Degradation (High Risk - 25% probability)
**Impact**: NoSQL implementation might not achieve 60% performance targets, potentially causing worse performance than current SQL.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Establish comprehensive performance baselines before migration
- Implement proper DocumentDB indexing and query optimization
- MongoDB connection pooling and caching with Redis
- Gradual rollout with A/B testing between SQL and NoSQL paths
- 4-hour rollback window if performance targets not met

### 3. Cross-Database Consistency Issues (High Risk - 30% probability)
**Impact**: Data consistency problems between SQL users and NoSQL documents could lead to authorization failures and orphaned data.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Denormalize UserId in NoSQL documents for validation
- Application-level referential integrity constraints
- Automated cross-database integrity checks with alerting
- Real-time monitoring dashboard for data consistency metrics
- Automated data repair scripts for common consistency issues

## Definition of Done

## Immediate Next Steps and Dependencies

### Week 1 Prerequisites
1. **Stakeholder Approval**: Get formal approval for AWS DocumentDB selection and migration timeline
2. **AWS Infrastructure**: Provision DocumentDB cluster and configure security groups
3. **Team Preparation**: Schedule MongoDB training sessions for development team
4. **Performance Baseline**: Establish current performance metrics for comparison

### Critical Dependencies
1. **AWS Account Access**: DocumentDB provisioning requires appropriate AWS permissions
