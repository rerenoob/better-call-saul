# NoSQL Data Layer Migration - Risk Assessment

**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Version**: 1.0

## High-Risk Items

### Risk 1: Data Loss During Migration
**Impact Level**: Critical  
**Probability**: Low (10%)  
**Risk Category**: Technical

**Description**:
Potential for data loss or corruption during the migration from SQL Server to DocumentDB, especially for complex nested objects that require transformation.

**Potential Impacts**:
- Complete loss of case analysis data
- Corruption of document metadata and relationships
- Legal compliance violations due to missing audit trails
- Client trust and reputation damage
- Potential lawsuit liability

**Specific Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Comprehensive Backup Strategy**:
   - Full SQL Server backup before migration starts
   - DocumentDB backup and point-in-time recovery enabled
   - Local backup copies stored in multiple locations

2. **Dual-Write Safety Net**:
   - Maintain SQL as authoritative during migration
   - Write to both databases during transition period
   - Automated data consistency validation every hour

3. **Incremental Migration**:
   - Migrate data in small batches (100 records at a time)
   - Validate each batch before proceeding
   - Immediate rollback capability for any failed batch

4. **Data Validation Scripts**:
   - Automated comparison between SQL and NoSQL data
   - Row count validation, data integrity checks
   - Business rule validation (relationships, constraints)

**Contingency Plan**:
- If data loss detected: Immediate rollback to SQL-only operation
- Full system restore from backup within 2 hours
- Data recovery procedures tested and documented

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation
**Impact Level**: High  
**Probability**: Medium (25%)  
**Risk Category**: Technical

**Description**:
Initial NoSQL implementation may not achieve expected 60% performance improvement, potentially causing worse performance than current SQL implementation.

**Potential Impacts**:
- User experience degradation with slower page loads
- API response time increases affecting client applications
- Increased infrastructure costs due to poor query optimization
- Developer productivity loss due to complex cross-database queries

**Specific Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Performance Baseline**:
   - Establish comprehensive performance metrics before migration
   - Document current query response times and throughput
   - Set clear performance benchmarks for acceptance

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Design proper indexing strategy for DocumentDB
   - Use aggregation pipelines for complex queries
   - Implement query result caching with Redis

3. **Connection Management**:
   - Optimize MongoDB connection pooling
   - Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Monitor connection limits and scaling requirements

4. **Gradual Rollout**:
   - Performance test with subset of users first
   - Monitor key metrics during dual-write phase
   - A/B testing between SQL and NoSQL query paths

**Contingency Plan**:
- If performance targets not met: Extend dual-write period
- Investigate and optimize query patterns
- Consider read replicas or sharding if needed
- Rollback option to SQL-only within 4 hours

### Risk 3: Cross-Database Consistency Issues
**Impact Level**: High  
**Probability**: Medium (30%)  
**Risk Category**: Technical

**Description**:
Data consistency problems between SQL Server (users) and DocumentDB (documents/analysis) could lead to orphaned data, authorization failures, or incorrect business logic.

**Potential Impacts**:
- Users unable to access their documents due to broken references
- Orphaned documents with no valid user ownership
- Authorization bypass vulnerabilities
- Audit trail inconsistencies
- Data integrity violations

**Specific Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Referential Integrity Patterns**:
   - Denormalize UserId in NoSQL documents for validation
   - Implement application-level foreign key constraints
   - Regular reconciliation jobs to detect orphaned data

2. **Transaction Coordination**:
   - Use distributed transaction patterns where needed
   - Implement saga pattern for complex multi-database operations
   - Eventual consistency with compensating actions

3. **Data Validation**:
   - Automated cross-database integrity checks
   - Business rule validation across both databases
   - User access validation before document operations

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Real-time monitoring of data consistency
   - Alerts for orphaned records or broken references
   - Dashboard showing cross-database health metrics

**Contingency Plan**:
- Automated data repair scripts for common consistency issues
- Manual data reconciliation procedures
- Ability to rebuild NoSQL data from SQL authoritative source

### Risk 4: Team Learning Curve
**Impact Level**: Medium  
**Probability**: High (60%)  
**Risk Category**: Resource/Skills

**Description**:
Development team's limited experience with NoSQL databases, MongoDB query patterns, and cross-database architectures could lead to implementation delays and quality issues.

**Potential Impacts**:
- Extended development timeline beyond 15-16 day estimate
- Poor query performance due to inexperience with MongoDB optimization
- Security vulnerabilities from improper NoSQL configuration
- Code quality issues requiring extensive refactoring
- Increased debugging time for cross-database issues

**Specific Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Knowledge Transfer**:
   - MongoDB training sessions for development team
   - Code review with NoSQL best practices checklist
   - Pair programming for initial repository implementations

2. **External Expertise**:
   - Consultation with MongoDB experts for architecture review
   - Code review by experienced NoSQL developers
   - AWS DocumentDB specialists for optimization guidance

3. **Incremental Learning**:
   - Start with simple CRUD operations before complex queries
   - Build proof-of-concept with key entities first
   - Gradually increase complexity as team gains experience

4. **Documentation and Standards**:
   - Comprehensive coding standards for NoSQL development
   - Repository pattern templates and examples
   - Troubleshooting guides for common issues

**Contingency Plan**:
- Add 25% buffer time to development estimates
- Engage external contractors if timeline becomes critical
- Consider simplified implementation for initial release
