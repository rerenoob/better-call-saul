# Task: OCR Service Integration Verification

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-004 OCR Integration Verification and Fix
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 5 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 01-azure-service-config/001-azure-form-recognizer-audit.md: Need Form Recognizer validation
- [ ] 03-file-upload-service/002-document-creation-fix.md: Need Document entities

### External Dependencies
- Azure Form Recognizer service access
- Test documents for OCR processing
- DocumentText entity model

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/OCR/AzureFormRecognizerService.cs`: Review and test
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/FileProcessing/TextExtractionService.cs`: Fix integration
- `BetterCallSaul.Tests/Services/OCR/FormRecognizerServiceTests.cs`: Add test coverage

### Code Patterns
- Follow Azure SDK patterns for Form Recognizer client
- Use existing patterns in `Services/OCR/` directory
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OCR service successfully extracts text from PDF documents
- [ ] DocumentText entities are created with extracted content
- [ ] Multi-page document processing works correctly
- [ ] Error handling for unsupported file formats
- [ ] Processing timeout handled gracefully (30-second limit)
- [ ] Integration between FileUploadService and OCR service verified

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Mock Form Recognizer responses for various scenarios
- Integration tests: Test with real Azure Form Recognizer service
- Manual validation: Upload test documents and verify text extraction

## System Stability
- OCR failures don't prevent file upload completion
- Retry logic for transient Azure service failures
- Proper resource cleanup for failed OCR operations
- Processing status updates reflect OCR results

## Rollback Strategy
- OCR processing can be disabled via configuration flag
- Mock OCR service can be used as fallback
- Changes isolated to OCR service implementation
