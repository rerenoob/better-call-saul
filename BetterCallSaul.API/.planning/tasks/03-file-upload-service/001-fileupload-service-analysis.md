# Task: FileUploadService Analysis and Diagnosis

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-003 File Upload Service Enhancement
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 02-logging-monitoring/001-structured-logging-setup.md: Need logging to debug issues

### External Dependencies
- Access to current FileUploadService implementation
- Production database access for troubleshooting
- File storage configuration (local/Azure)

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/FileProcessing/FileUploadService.cs`: Analyze current implementation
- `Analysis-FileUploadService.md`: Document findings and issues identified
- `BetterCallSaul.Tests/Services/FileUploadServiceTests.cs`: Review existing tests

### Code Patterns
- Follow existing service patterns in `Services/FileProcessing/` directory
- Use dependency injection patterns for testability
- Follow async/await patterns for I/O operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete analysis of current FileUploadService.ProcessFileAsync method
- [ ] Identify specific points where Document creation may fail
- [ ] Document file storage transaction boundaries and potential issues
- [ ] Review error handling and exception management
- [ ] Analyze database transaction scope and commit timing
- [ ] Identify why OCR text extraction may not be called

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Create tests that reproduce current failure scenarios
- Integration tests: Test with actual database and file storage
- Manual validation: Step through service method with debugger

## System Stability
- Analysis is read-only and doesn't modify existing functionality
- Test cases help isolate issues without affecting production
- Documentation provides roadmap for fixes

## Rollback Strategy
- Pure analysis task with no code changes
- Tests can be disabled if they interfere with existing functionality
- Documentation can be updated based on findings
