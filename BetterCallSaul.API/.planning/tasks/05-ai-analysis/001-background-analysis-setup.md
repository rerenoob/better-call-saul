# Task: Background AI Analysis Processing Setup

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-005 Background AI Analysis Processing
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 01-azure-service-config/002-azure-openai-audit.md: Need OpenAI service validation
- [ ] 04-ocr-integration/001-ocr-service-verification.md: Need extracted text

### External Dependencies
- Azure OpenAI service access
- Background job processing infrastructure (Hangfire/Azure Functions)
- SignalR hub for real-time updates

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/BackgroundJobs/CaseAnalysisJob.cs`: New background job
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/AI/CaseAnalysisService.cs`: Review and enhance
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Hubs/ProcessingHub.cs`: SignalR hub for progress updates
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Program.cs`: Register background job services

### Code Patterns
- Follow existing AI service patterns in `Services/AI/` directory
- Use background job patterns (Hangfire or Azure Functions)
- Implement SignalR hub patterns for real-time communication

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Background job processes extracted text for AI case analysis
- [ ] CaseAnalysis entities created with structured analysis results
- [ ] SignalR hub sends real-time progress updates to users
- [ ] Retry mechanism handles Azure OpenAI service failures
- [ ] Analysis includes viability scores, legal issues, recommendations
- [ ] Processing queue handles multiple concurrent analysis requests

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Mock Azure OpenAI responses and verify analysis creation
- Integration tests: Test complete workflow from text extraction to analysis
- Manual validation: Upload document and verify analysis completion notification

## System Stability
- Analysis failures don't affect file upload or OCR processing
- Queue management prevents resource exhaustion
- Graceful handling of Azure OpenAI rate limits and quotas
- Background processing doesn't impact application performance

## Rollback Strategy
- Background analysis can be disabled via configuration
- Mock analysis service can provide placeholder results
- SignalR integration is optional and can be removed
