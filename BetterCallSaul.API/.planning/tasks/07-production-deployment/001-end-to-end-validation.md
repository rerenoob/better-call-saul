# Task: Production End-to-End Validation

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-007 Production Deployment and Validation
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- [ ] 06-ui-integration/001-case-detail-integration.md: Need complete UI integration
- [ ] All previous implementation tasks completed

### External Dependencies
- Production environment access
- Test documents for validation
- Monitoring dashboard access

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `validation-script.sh`: Automated validation script for production
- `test-documents/`: Sample documents for production testing
- `production-validation-report.md`: Document validation results

### Code Patterns
- Follow existing testing patterns for integration validation
- Use curl/Playwright for automated API and UI testing
- Implement comprehensive health check validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] File upload creates Document records in production database
- [ ] OCR processing populates DocumentText table with extracted content
- [ ] AI analysis creates CaseAnalysis records with structured results
- [ ] Case detail pages display extracted text and analysis results
- [ ] Processing errors properly logged and surfaced to users
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable thresholds (upload <10s, OCR <30s, analysis <60s)

## Testing Strategy
- Automated validation: Script tests complete workflow
- Manual validation: Human review of results quality
- Performance validation: Measure processing times under load

## System Stability
- Validation doesn't impact production users
- Test data is clearly marked and can be cleaned up
- Rollback plan ready if critical issues found

## Rollback Strategy
- Complete rollback plan to previous working version
- Database cleanup procedures for test data
- Clear communication plan for any discovered issues
