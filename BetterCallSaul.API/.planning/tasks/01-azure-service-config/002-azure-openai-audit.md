# Task: Azure OpenAI Configuration Audit

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-001 Azure Service Configuration Audit
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- None (Can run parallel with Form Recognizer audit)

### External Dependencies
- Access to production Azure OpenAI service
- Production environment application settings
- Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Controllers/HealthController.cs`: Add OpenAI health check endpoint
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/HealthChecks/OpenAIHealthCheck.cs`: New health check implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/AI/AzureOpenAIService.cs`: Review and fix configuration
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Program.cs`: Register OpenAI health check

### Code Patterns
- Follow Azure SDK authentication patterns
- Use existing AI service patterns in `Services/AI/` directory
- Implement proper retry policies with Polly library

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key validated in production
- [ ] Model deployment availability confirmed (GPT-4, text-davinci-003, etc.)
- [ ] Health check endpoint `/health/openai` returns healthy status
- [ ] Rate limiting and quota consumption monitored
- [ ] Test completion call succeeds with proper authentication

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Mock Azure OpenAI client with various response scenarios
- Integration tests: Test against Azure OpenAI service with test prompts
- Manual validation: Execute test analysis request and verify successful completion

## System Stability
- Health check uses minimal token consumption for testing
- Failed health checks don't impact existing case analysis operations
- Proper error handling for quota exceeded scenarios

## Rollback Strategy
- Health check endpoint can be disabled via feature flag
- No changes to existing AI analysis workflow
- Easy to revert configuration changes if needed
