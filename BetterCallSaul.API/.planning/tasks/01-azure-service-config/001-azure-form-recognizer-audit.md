# Task: Azure Form Recognizer Configuration Audit

## Overview
- **Parent Feature**: IMPL-001 Azure Service Configuration Audit
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Status**: Not Started

## Dependencies
### Required Tasks
- None (Foundation task)

### External Dependencies
- Access to production Azure portal
- Production environment application settings
- Azure Form Recognizer service instance

## Implementation Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Controllers/HealthController.cs`: Add Form Recognizer health check
- `BetterCallSaul.Infrastructure/Services/HealthChecks/FormRecognizerHealthCheck.cs`: New health check implementation
- `BetterCallSaul.API/Program.cs`: Register Form Recognizer health check
- `appsettings.Production.json`: Validate Form Recognizer configuration

### Code Patterns
- Follow existing health check patterns in `Controllers/HealthController.cs`
- Use Azure SDK dependency injection patterns
- Follow structured logging conventions with Serilog

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Azure Form Recognizer endpoint configuration validated in production
- [ ] Service credentials tested and confirmed working
- [ ] Health check endpoint `/health/form-recognizer` returns healthy status
- [ ] Configuration validation logs any missing or invalid settings
- [ ] Documentation updated with required environment variables

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Mock Azure Form Recognizer client responses
- Integration tests: Test against Azure Form Recognizer emulator
- Manual validation: Call health check endpoint and verify response

## System Stability
- Health check endpoint provides monitoring visibility without affecting processing
- Failed health checks log warnings but don't crash application
- Graceful degradation if Form Recognizer is temporarily unavailable

## Rollback Strategy
- Health check is additive - can be disabled via configuration
- No impact on existing functionality
- Easy to remove health check registration if needed
