### Task 6: User Interface Status Integration
**ID:** IMPL-006
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** IMPL-005
**Priority:** Medium

#### Description
Update the case detail page and file upload interface to display processing status and results from the fixed pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Case detail page displays extracted text from DocumentText entities
- AI analysis results shown with proper formatting from CaseAnalysis entities
- Processing status indicators show current state (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Error messages provide actionable guidance for users
- Upload interface shows processing progress with real-time updates

#### Implementation Details
- Update CaseController GetCase method to include all related entities (already completed)
- Enhance frontend case detail page to display extracted text and analysis
- Implement real-time status updates using SignalR integration
- Add error state handling with user-friendly messages and retry options
- Create processing progress indicators for upload and analysis workflows

### Task 7: Production Deployment and Validation
**ID:** IMPL-007
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** IMPL-001 through IMPL-006
**Priority:** High

#### Description
Deploy fixes to production environment and validate that file processing pipeline works end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- All fixes deployed to production without breaking existing functionality
- File upload creates Document records in production database
- OCR processing populates DocumentText table with extracted content
- AI analysis creates CaseAnalysis records with structured results
- Case detail pages display extracted text and analysis results
- Processing errors are properly logged and surfaced to users

#### Implementation Details

## Critical Path and Parallel Work

### Critical Path
1. IMPL-001 (Azure Service Configuration) → IMPL-003 (File Upload Fix) → IMPL-004 (OCR Fix) → IMPL-007 (Production Deployment)

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- IMPL-002 (Logging Infrastructure) can be developed in parallel with IMPL-001
- IMPL-005 (AI Analysis) can be developed in parallel with IMPL-004
- IMPL-006 (UI Integration) can be developed after IMPL-004 completes

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: IMPL-001, IMPL-002 - 2 days
- **Phase 2 (Core Processing)**: IMPL-003, IMPL-004 - 3 days  
- **Phase 3 (Analysis & UI)**: IMPL-005, IMPL-006 - 2 days
- **Phase 4 (Deployment)**: IMPL-007 - 1 day
- **Total Estimated Time**: 8 days with parallel work, 10 days sequential

## Integration Points

### Database Changes
- Add ProcessingStatus enum to Document entity
- Ensure proper Entity Framework navigation properties
- Database migration for any schema changes

### External Service Integration
- Azure Form Recognizer API calls with proper error handling
- Azure OpenAI API integration with retry logic
- SignalR hub configuration for real-time updates

### Frontend Integration
