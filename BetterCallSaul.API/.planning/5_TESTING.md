## Critical Test Scenarios

### High Priority Test Cases

#### TC001: End-to-End File Processing Success
- **Given**: Valid PDF file uploaded by authenticated user
- **When**: File processing completes successfully
- **Then**: Document, DocumentText, and CaseAnalysis records created
- **And**: Case detail page displays extracted text and analysis results

#### TC002: OCR Processing Failure Recovery
- **Given**: File upload triggers OCR processing
- **When**: Azure Form Recognizer service is unavailable
- **Then**: Processing retries with exponential backoff
- **And**: User receives meaningful error message after max retries
- **And**: Manual reprocessing option is available

#### TC003: Database Transaction Rollback
- **Given**: File upload and Document creation begin
- **When**: Database operation fails during processing
- **Then**: Uploaded file is cleaned up from storage
- **And**: No orphaned records remain in database
- **And**: User receives clear error feedback

#### TC004: Concurrent Processing Load
- **Given**: Multiple users upload files simultaneously
- **When**: System processes 20+ concurrent uploads
- **Then**: All files process successfully without conflicts
- **And**: Processing times remain within acceptable limits
- **And**: No resource exhaustion or memory leaks occur

### Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

#### EC001: Unsupported File Types
- **Test**: Upload files with various unsupported extensions
- **Expectation**: Clear validation errors with supported format guidance
- **Validation**: No processing attempts for unsupported files

#### EC002: Corrupted File Handling
- **Test**: Upload corrupted or incomplete files
- **Expectation**: OCR processing fails gracefully with specific error messages
- **Validation**: No system crashes or resource leaks

#### EC003: Service Quota Exhaustion
- **Test**: Simulate Azure service quota limits being reached
- **Expectation**: Graceful queuing and retry mechanisms activate
- **Validation**: Users receive appropriate feedback about delays

## Automated vs Manual Testing

### Automated Testing (80% of validation)
- Unit tests for all service methods and business logic
- Integration tests for database and Azure service operations
- API endpoint testing for all file processing workflows
- Performance regression testing for critical scenarios
- Security scanning for common vulnerabilities

### Manual Testing (20% of validation)
- User experience validation for complex workflows
- Cross-browser compatibility for file upload interface
- Production environment smoke testing after deployments
- Exploratory testing for edge cases and unusual scenarios
- Accessibility testing for file upload and status interfaces

## Testing Environment Requirements

### Development Testing
- Local SQL Server or SQLite database
- Azure service emulators or mock implementations
- Sample test files representing various document types
- Isolated environment for concurrent testing

### Staging Testing
- Production-equivalent Azure services with separate quotas
- Production-scale database with test data
- Load balancing and scaling configuration matching production
- Full monitoring and logging infrastructure

### Production Validation
- Smoke testing framework for post-deployment validation
- Health check endpoints for continuous monitoring
- A/B testing capability for gradual feature rollout
- Rollback testing procedures for emergency scenarios

## Success Criteria

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 85% code coverage for service layer
- **Integration Tests**: 100% coverage of critical workflow paths
- **End-to-End Tests**: All user-facing scenarios validated
- **Performance Tests**: Baseline metrics established with acceptable thresholds

### Quality Gates
- All automated tests pass before deployment
- Performance tests meet or exceed baseline metrics
- Security scanning reports no high-severity vulnerabilities
- Manual testing sign-off from product team

## Next Steps
1. Implement unit test suite for enhanced FileUploadService
2. Create integration tests for Azure service connectivity
3. Develop end-to-end test scenarios using Playwright
4. Establish performance testing baseline and thresholds
5. Set up automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
